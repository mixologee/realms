The Gaping Entrance to a Cave~
Here light from the outside still illuminates the ground, but beyond lies utter
darkness- hopefully you throught to bring a light. It seems the cave were made
by countless ages of dripping water, judging from the small streams of water
running into the depths of the cave. A faint warm breeze blows from within...
What could be down there?

Descending into Darkness~
Leaving the light behind you, there is only darkness ahead. Holding your light
aloft you can see that every surface is wet with water flowing from the cave
mouth. The air has a consistent warmth to it unusual for a cave, but it is not
comfortably warm due to the high humidity. The path continues south from here.

Descending into Darkness~
That last pinpoint of light from the surface world is far away, just a glint on
the cave walls now. Fortunately you have your light to guide you, however long
it lasts. The breeze flowing out of the cavern is moister here than near the
cave entrance- perhaps there is water below your feet.

The First Bend in the Tunnel~
Without your light, you would have failed to notice the steep drop before you,
and could have become lost in the tumble down never to return to the surface
world. You hear a stone fall nearby- you are not alone.

At an Intersection in the Cavern~
A short stumble down the passage takes you to a four-way intersection, branching
off in each of the cardinal directions. Every path looks the same, equally wet
with dripping water and soft brown clay. The breeze blows from the south one
moment, then the east, then the west, remaining inconsistent in its source. 
The dripping of water into pools creates a sort of symphony that echoes through
the many passages.

Deeper in the Cave~
The southbound tunnel is quite muddy and wet, with a steady stream winding south
over the thick clay. A shovel lies forgotten in one corner, probably left by
some idle fortune-seeker coming to gather some of the rich clay that makes the
finest pottery and potting soil.

A Hollowed-Out Vein of Rock~
A rocky tunnel presents itself where hard stone could not be worn away by the
dripping water so easily as limestone and clay. The tunnel is littered with
stones that have come loose in the many ages of flowing water. The stream flows
to the east from here, coming down the incline from the west.

A Tall Cavern, Filled with Bats~
The vaulted ceiling of this cavern resembles a sort of makeshift cathedral, with
dozens of bats chittering and climbing about as the monks and a large stalactite
their altar. The mud is not so deep here, and the water not so quick moving-
you do not linger, because the swooping bats may become entangled in your
equipment.

A Tight Squeeze in the Muddy Tunnel~
There is only enough room for one person to move through at a time here, as the
path is constricted to only being a meter wide. The mud is particularly deep,
and the water runs high in the tunnel. Bats don't even come to this place, as
there is no place to hang or hide.

Beneath a Clay Overhang~
In this small, cramped chamber of clay the sounds of the world outside seem to
vanish. Holy engravings line the walls, possibly the result of some local
tribesman priest attempting to create a safe place for travellers to rest free
of danger. The attempt must have worked- a sort of tranquility permeates the
very walls and flows in the air of this haven.

Despite the constantly flowing water an outcropping of granite to the west has

to the south, leading to what sounds like a waterfall.

A Deep Channel Approaching the Waterfall~
Where all the streams come together it creates a mighty underground river. The
water is dirty with silt, and the current curves and runs over large rocks
wedged in the side of the wall. To the south, the water rushes down into the
earth where a subterranean lake has formed.

The pounding water forces you to your knees on a lone ledge of granite. The

lies an unknowable distance below you- your light does not reach far enough to

The waterfall comes to a crashing halt in a deep pool, fortunately not too far
from the ledge above, a mere seven meter drop. The water froths from the air
bubbles rising up from the bottom of the lake, and smells faintly of rot and wet
chalk. No point of friendly rock is to be found in this deep part of the lake,
so rest must be found elsewhere.

The gradually sloping granite floor rises up above the water, becoming almost
dry land where you stand. A ring of detritus lies on the ground at various
heights, the result of rainstorms past flooding the cavern. Salt crystals have
dried up at the waterline and encrust the jetsam lying on the stone floor, and
it seems something that lives down here must find this stuff edible judging from
the bite-shaped chunks missing from the ring closest to the water.

The creatures of this cavern have adapted to the sickening atmosphere of decay
and lack of sunlight, living quite comfortably below the surface of the earth.

so rest must be found elsewhere.

A Bubbling Mud Pool~
A bubbling pool of warm mud gushes up from a hole in the stone far below your
dangling feet, and you struggle to stay afloat in the tossing current of filth.
Here it gushes up, there it sinks down again, and all around is chaos. 
Something graps onto your foot, something with painful biting suckers!

A Deep, Clean Pool~
Unusual for this cave, this alcove is spotlessly clean. This is probably due to
a cold spring that rises from the many holes in the stone floor. Amethyst
crystals of varying shapes and sizes protrude from the walls, low ceiling, and
cavern floor, and glint in the light.

A Secret Tunnel in the Underground Lake~
A rock slide has closed off the exit to the north, forming a self-sustaining
environment here, dominated by the dripping nutrient-rich water and giant
centipedes. Here there are not so many crystals, and a white sand has formed on
the ground as a result of their being torn down in the rockslide.

A Hollow Under the Lake~
Deep in the mud, you find the first vegetation in this underground lake that you
have seen. It waves rythmically in the water as if of its own volition, bright
green and inviting. The bones of countless fish lie about in the mud, broken
and mashed into an almost paste-like substance. A brown leather boot lies on
the surface of the mud, mysteriously unaffected by the nibblings of fish. The
mud closes over your head as you sink lower- perhaps it can be forced open.

In a Glistening Room Coated with Ice~
The air here is still, wet, and cold, and has created a slippery coating of ice
on every surface. Examining the ice closely, you can make out the forms of
small summer insects frozen within it that flew into this cave and became
entombed in the ice when they stopped to rest. The smell of decay is not so
strong here, and the breeze that could be felt in the upper tunnels blows
strongly here, cold and harsh. It must have become warm going over the lake and
up the waterfall.

Here is the source of the blood, cold, dead, and entombed in a thick layer of
ice- one would imagine this is the work of an ice drake. Why this warrior
crossed the drake is unknowable, perhaps he sought fame in defeating a drake
alone, or attempted to steal its treasure, or perhaps it sensed an evil aura
about him and attacked. In any case, he is as dead as the walls are cold.

prehistoric man conversing with a beautiful woman, hovering and enshrouded in
mist. Another glyph illustrates the nature of this underground temple- a system
of connected, interwoven concentric circles.

Another Dead End~
There are so many dead ends in this cave it almost seems that there is NO way
out. Some metal bits have been deposited here by a bone ooze, useless to it but
possibly precious to you.

A Small Alcove~
It looks like a bone ooze began carving a tunnel here and then ran into stout
resistance in the form of a vein of solid iron, running parallel to the main
path. The vein of iron ore is scratched, but not at all worn away.

Within an Icy Temple~
The air here is stingingly cold, swirling and flinging sharp ice crystals in all
directions. A dim light flickers over the pews of this temple far ahead, urging
you to step inside and seek company- but the company you find, might not be the
kind you wish to keep.

In the Back Pews~
The air is still and crisp from the cold, and your breath freezes solid in the
air before your eyes, then shatters. The place is almost supernaturally cold,
more than it would be even if everything were as icy as outside the church. 
The pews are made of soft-looking light brown wood, which is probably preserved
by the intense cold. Several rows of pews lead up to the altar at the front of
the chamber.

How aggrivating! The path in the cavern maze comes to a dead halt at a wall of
stone. The white powder of what used to be bones piles up in a corner and fills

A Dead End~
The ceiling, which you have not seen up to this point, dips down to about
fifteen meters overhead and slopes at a sharp angle to the ground, closing off
the tunnel to the west. A mass of rubble lies against the north wall, where a
portion of the ceiling collapsed in and broke on the high passage wall.

A Spotless Tunnel~
Every square centimeter of this downward-sloping tunnel is spotless, lacking any
dust or cobwebs. The intense cold makes it impossible for any normal creature
to linger here long, so the rocks are without fungus or the glowing bacteria
that typically inhabits caves. To the east, the tunnel slopes upwards again.

is escape from this frightening place.

A Subterranean Bone Yard~
The white powder covers the ground all around you, and strips of flesh lie
against the walls. You can hear the ooze lurching about in the dark. It seems
to echo from every corner of the darkness, from all sides, surrounding you. 
The sound of it moving about, the darkness, the bones- all you can think about
is escape from this frightening place.

Nearing a Pool of Clear Water~
Ahead to the north lies a wide pool of water with a beach of white sand,
surrounded by bones. The walls are unscarred by the disolving agents released
from the bone ooze's flesh, so perhaps the beast does not venture this close to
water.

At a Clear Pool, with a Sandy Bottom~
A steady drip of water has created a pool in a hole in the ground, with a white
sandy bottom. The water is clear and still, and surrounded by the bones of
creatures like rats and some humans that managed to get this far in the cave. 
Perhaps you should avoid drinking this water.

On the Far Side of the Pool~
A dozen stalagmites protrude from the floor where water has been dripping for
eons and formed the pool to the south. The source of the poisoning is obvious
here- cloudy yellow quartz crystals, that hint at the presence of sulfur.

Deep in the Cold Pool~
The sand is deeper and thicker than it appeared from the surface, and while the
water is refreshing something in the water stings your eyes and skin, and the
sand makes it difficult to swim back up to solid ground.

A Glowing Labyrinth of Metal Walls~
Suddenly, the atmosphere changes in a way your mortal mind cannot perceive- it
is as if a continual sound you could only feel in your soul has ceased, replaced
by another. The air is lighter in your lungs, and every solid surface seems to
have a pull of its own. The three walls of the tunnel pull in every direction,
creating the effect of jumping in an elevator. You are no longer on the
material plane, it would seem. The runes lining the wall blink and flash,
leading you further into the labyrinth.

A Glowing Labyrinth of Metal Walls~
This strange labyrinth slopes gradually down into the earth- if that is where
you are now. The air is lighter in your lungs, and every solid surface seems to
have a pull of its own. The three walls of the tunnel pull in every direction,
creating the effect of jumping in an elevator. You are no longer on the
material plane, it would seem. The runes lining the wall blink and flash,
leading you further into the labyrinth.

have a pull of its own. The three walls of the tunnel pull in every direction,
creating the effect of jumping in an elevator. You are no longer on the
material plane, it would seem. The runes lining the wall blink and flash,
leading you further into the labyrinth.

The Heart of the Caverns~
This chamber glows brilliantly with a steady cool green light that comes from
the metal walls. A thumping sound fills the air- it is the heartbeat of the
earth, which can be heard here on the elemental plane of Earth so deep in the
ground. A stone slab rises from the floor of the cylindrical chamber, upon
which rests a sleeping goddess.

This door is as tall as it is wide, and a large portion of its center is a thick

A Hidden Office~
This office is shaped like a cube, if you twisted the top and bottom in opposite
directions and put little cubbies in the walls, ceiling and floor. Just when
you realize this doesn't make sense, the room RoTatEs, putting you on the
ceiling, opposite the thick iron door engraved with runes. Opposite the door is
a large desk, stacked with papers and manned by a well-endowed secretary. 
Little shiny things are set neatly in every box and every corner- just the way a
magpie likes it.

Hooray, light! A way out! You'd best hurry and scramble your way up the wall,
before some awful stroke of fate snatches the exit away from you, and leaves you
to die deep below ground.

In the Pews~
As you near the pulpit it becomes increasingly clear that this is no holy place.
Tattered red and black banners hang from the crumbling stone rafters, and an
aura of evil surrounds the place. The pews are constructed in a harsh manner,
which may reflect the beliefs of their creator.

In the Pews~
You descend the sloped central aisle, and a sense of panic grips you. The air
is growing steadily cold, and you feel you are not alone here, and half expect
someone, or something, to leap out at you from the darkness between the pews.

In the Front Pews~
These pews are at the very foot of the pulpit. The aura of evil is strongest
here, and the air is bitingly cold, sharp enough to cut skin. Your skin freezes
before your very eyes, splitting and cracking in ways skin is not meant to. A
fire burns beyond the pulpit, but it throws off no noticeable heat. Shadows
dance off the wall, and quiet chants echo through the chamber.

At the Base of an Altar~
Red flames flicker on the icy walls and an altar of rare red jade. The altar is
broad and shaped like a bowl, with slots in the southern side for blood spilled
in its basin to drain into the pit in the center of the floor, from which hisses
and shrieks are emitted from time to time. A figurine peers seductively over
the basin, one depicting a busty jade goddess, and behind that rises the
clenched fist of Hextor, gripping a fistful of black arrows. A heavy door rises
to the east and west.

The Priest's Chamber~
The room is quaint- a priest's style doesn't seem to change with alignment, not
-religious- alignment anyway. A rickety bed sits in the corner, and a toilet
sits in the other. The walls, floor, and ceiling are all stone, and all covered
in ice from the dripping water.

A Chamber Filled with Stolen Goods~
All manner of bits and bobs litter the floor and line the walls, but a few
objects stand out from the rest as potentially useful or interesting- a few
piles of assorted coins, some equipment, a broken mirror, and some human bones.
Some of the things that have sat longer than the rest are embedded in a thick
layer of ice, adhered to the wall.

At the Bottom of a Steep, Icy Pit~
You land in the pit with a thud. It echoes in the small chamber, and multiple
somethings shift about in the darkness. Things crunch under your feet, and
reptilian claws scrape across your feet, followed by a long barbed tail. The
firelight of the altar flickers far above your head, and surprisingly, you find
yourself wishing you were there rather than here.
