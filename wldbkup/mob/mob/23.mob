Eithne~
A tuxedo cat with a crinkled nose is curled in a ball dozing.
~
This small cat is mostly black, with a white face, white mittens on her front
paws, and white legs.  A black spot slightly off center under her nose gives her
the appearance of a Charlie Chaplin mustache.  Her long black tail has a kink in
the end.
