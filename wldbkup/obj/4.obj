down into the Taris'Vaal caverns. Alas, he was too late- upon finding the skull
of his lover, with a few strands of golden hair still attached to the skull and
the locket around what remained of her neck, he went mad. There he remained,
for the rest of his days, clutching the skull of his beloved and screaming
wildly in rage.
