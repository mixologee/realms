Chapter I: The Ancient World Across Waters
Many ages ago, in a land far removed by water and magical boundaries, there was
a land known by its residents as Medievia. It was created and ruled by a wise
and fair man, and his first disciples were kind, and they prospered as a result
of their ... .. .. ...... In time, their almighty deity grew old, and
cynical, and blind to the needs of his faithful. He answered to the whims of
the longest running, fanatical dynasties, and to the most powerful clans. The
faithful were lost in his attempts to keep the

World from being torn apart, by appeasing these pow. Rfu. .... .... .. . 
The faithful, foreseeing the destruction of their homeland by internal forces,
fled on ships to the edge of the world. Their most powerful parted the barrier

D. There they discovered in time the great Goddess, Kuvia, who we know and love
to this day. Among those first sailors were members of clans that are now
defunct, such as the Dark Nomads and Altas Fidelitas. These clans I know will
come to rise again, under different names, but equally noble causes. ... The
rest of the book is torn and waterstained, continuing on page 386 -
appropriately, on the same subject of the clans and the prophecy.

Come they will, in time, when their world is consumed by war and overrun with
the Khrait race, when their world is eventually taken and corrupted by the
coming of Hellruler. The great bloodlines of Kwe and Sorcio and Myth shall come
and prosper under the new sun. Altus Fidelitas and the Dark Nomads and White
Rose will rise again, and so too will the Seventh Circle and Rise of Mayhem and
Fate, but it will be a different world - at least in the beginning. I fear the
advent of a second ... .. .. .....

Which must be safeguarded against by the deities of this realm, so that we do
not fall prey to corruption, because then we will not be strong enough to fend
of the Hellruler.
