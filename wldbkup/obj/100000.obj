E
crystal~
This gate is made up of a crystal unknown in origin.  It is cool to the touch,
even though it seems to be radiating heat from its pulsing nodes.
~
E
node~
Looking closer you can make out a few nodes on the archway.  Each node has a set
of runic symbols that glow and pulse in tune with the archway.
~
E
symbol~
The symbols are all set in groups of three, no two sets alike.  Looking closer
you can make out a circle, star, and moon symbol amongst the others.
~
E
circle~
This symbol looks like a perfectly round circle.  Its glow pulses with the
rhythm of the archway.  You have no idea what the symbol may stand for.
~
E
star~
This symbol looks like a five-pointed star.  Its glow pulses with the rythym of
the archway.  The only meaning you can figure for this symbol would be the
heavens above.
~
E
moon~
This symbol looks like a crescent moon.  Its glow pulses with the rhythm of the
archway.  It seems to reference the open sky above.
