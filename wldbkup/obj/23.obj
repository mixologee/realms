collar~
a cat collar with a silver charm~
A small charm winks up at you from this circle of fabric.~
This thin cloth collar is so small it would fit a cat, and nothing larger.  It
is an off-white color, which black musical notes painted on it.  A small silver
heart dangles from the clasp, on which the words 'I am loved' have been
engraved.
