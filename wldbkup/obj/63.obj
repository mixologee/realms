and Vrice bought them up with the money from the followers of his game. In an
effort to impress the people around him with his talent, he put them on and
found they would not come off! So after a long ordeal somehow they broke. 
They still make a good pair of wristbands, though.

a lurker skin cloak, emblazoned with the symbol of Change~
A shadow-woven cloak darts away from the light.~
The trick to making this cloak wasn't so much subduing a lurker but getting the
shadowy shreds of its hide to stay in place long enough to be woven into cloth.
The symbol of change consists of four scythes rotating clockwise, forming a
cross intersecting another cross of wheat, ripe for reaping. Four moons lie
between one blade's tip and the next one's beginning, going from full at the top
to new at the bottom and back, a never ending cycle of repeated and predictable
change.

a sailor's teeth), it is the ultimate boot-building material. The faintly red
black boots are laced with dragon whisker strings that go up the calf a good
ways before tying off in a neat knot.

the Greater Ring of Winter's Wrath~
A frosty coating of ice surrounds this silver ring, and a single rune pulses with white light upon it.~
The rune is a symbol of the raven, and the medicine it bestows upon its people.
It grants the person the ability to get travel between realms, manipulate the
world around them, and use great arcane powers- for good, or evil. This ring is
infused with such powers, strongly inherent within the creator of the ring.

Ouch, someone's wings have been removed and lie on the ground in a pool of black blood.~
Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
`Wretch,' I cried, `thy God hath lent thee - by these angels he has sent thee
Respite - respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!
Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore!'
Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'
`Prophet!' said I, `thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil! -
Whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted -
On this home by horror haunted - tell me truly, I implore -
Is there - is there balm in Gilead? - tell me - tell me, I implore!'
Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'
`Prophet!' said I, `thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil!
By that Heaven that bends above us - by that God we both adore -
Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels named Lenore -
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden, whom the angels named Lenore?'
Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'
`Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!' I shrieked upstarting -
`Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
Leave my loneliness unbroken! - quit the bust above my door!
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!'
Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'

Requiem Blade Vorpal Black~
Requiem, Accarid's Vorpal Blade~
This blade is thrust vertically into the ground, waiting patiently for its master.~
"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
  The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
  The frumious Bandersnatch!"
He took his vorpal sword in hand:
  Long time the manxome foe he sought --
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
  And stood awhile in thought.
And, as in uffish thought he stood,
  The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
  And burbled as it came!
One, two! One, two! And through and through
  The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its head
  He went galumphing back.
"And, has thou slain the Jabberwock?
  Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'
  He chortled in his joy.

This composite longbow would make any mortal archer shit his or herself with glee at being able to hand such a fine work of artistry. Simple, yet awesome, its black and white bands are each etched with a rune of power that ensure that the arrow will always hit the target- no matter what.

nest~
Something metallic shimmers from within this crumpled mass of twigs and grass.
The nest has been inexpertly woven together, and barely holds its shape.  No
bird appears to inhabit the nest anymore, and its flimsiness belies its effort
to safely shelter

hair gold silken strands~
Several strands of human hair have been braided together to form a thin plait.
The hairs shimmer and reflect light, and have a curious weight, almost as if
they weren't hair at all, but spun from solid gold.

the archway.  The only meaning you can figure for this symbol would be the
heavens above.

The symbols are all set in groups of three, no two sets alike.  Looking closer
you can make out a circle, star, and moon symbol amongst the others.

Looking closer you can make out a few nodes on the archway.  Each node has a set
of runic symbols that glow and pulse in tune with the archway.

crystal~
This gate is made up of a crystal unknown in origin.  It is cool to the touch,
even though it seems to be radiating heat from its pulsing nodes.
