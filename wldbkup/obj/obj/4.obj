lump goo phlegm reddish~
a lump of reddish goo~
This jiggling gel looks quite edible, even useful.~
How an avolakia managed to obtain such a substance is beyond knowing, but it

When Maravid learned that his fiance had been captured by an evil cleric and was
meant to be a sacrifice, he gathered a rescue team and made a frantic scramble
down into the Taris'Vaal caverns. Alas, he was too late- upon finding the skull
of his lover, with a few strands of golden hair still attached to the skull and
the locket around what remained of her neck, he went mad. There he remained,
for the rest of his days, clutching the skull of his beloved and screaming
wildly in rage.
