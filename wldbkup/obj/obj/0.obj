Sputnik bag sack light~
Sputnik, the Traveller's Companion~
This being has long existed in our world, a shining light to lead travellers to their appropriate destination- evildoers to the bottom of a cliff, for example. Finding a master at last, this spirit dubbed Sputnik has come to reside in a decorated flour sack, with a yellow smiley face on its silk exterior and purple tassels hanging off the corners. It floats about, emitting a gently pulsing white light that permeates the area.~
This flour sack seems delighted to see you, and soars about freely.

lurker skin cloak darkness shadow black~
a thick lurker-skin cloak~
A cloak of pure shadows slithers about on the ground, attempting to get away from the light.~
The challenge of making this cloak lay not in defeating the lurker (one must simply wait for it to drop down from above and keep it from fleeing) but in weaving the shadows together without them scattering in every direction in a coordinated attempt to escape.

death overcloak cloak symbol change wheat scythes moons~
Death's overcloak, emblazoned with the symbol of Change~
Death's cloak seems to have gotten away from him.~
Just below the shoulders is the symbol of change, stitched in liquid metal thread by means of magic. Four scythes pointing to the right intersect four crossed shoots of wheat just prime for reaping. Between the tip of one blade and the base of the next is a moon, going from full at the top, to half moon at the right, to new on the bottom, to half again on the left. The symbol seems to be ever rotating upon the cloak.

boots horsemeat meat stomping shiny~
a pair of shiny combat boots, practically made for stomping~
These boots are made of polished horsemeat. How disgustingly innovative.~
Horsemeat is reportedly among the strongest lightweight long-lasting materials known to mankind, and has long been used by sailors as a source of building material, for things from boxes to as you can see here boots. Flexible like rubber, hard like diamond, only a fine blade could cut such a substance as dried horsemeat.
