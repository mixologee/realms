Curing the guards~
   The guards seem to be getting sick more then normal. Some of the local
healers have been successful with treatment but they are unsure of why it
continues. Someone has suggested that the alley cats might have something to do
with it. Try killing ten cats and lets see if that helps.
~
The Taris'Vaal questmaster tells you, 'Thank you, with the cats gone the town is
much cleaner but the sickness continues.'

Curing the guards.~
Now that the cats didn't seem to help any I ask you to try the dogs. Killing 15
of the brown dogs walking around town should be enough to see if they might be
the cause of this sickness.
~
The Taris'Vaal questmaster tells you, 'The guards seem to be doing better I
think the dogs might have been the cause, thank you again.'
