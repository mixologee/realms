&YNew Commands&n

Here are a few new Zone commands that are now in-game.


Under the &WZEDIT&w menu you will see 2 new options, option M and F

Option &MF&n is for zone flags.  The following are new zone flags
that you can use and an explanation of what they are.
CLOSED  - the zone is closed for any mortals to enter, even if it is 
          linked to the map or through a normal pathway
!MASTER - master level players cannot enter this zone, this is a useful
          flag for newbie zones you do not want PKing to happen in  
QUEST   - Unused right now, but can be used to designate specific
          quest zones
GRID    - this flag means that this zone is open and "on the grid"
          this flag helps determine what zones show up with another
          new command explained below called "areas"
!BUILD  - this flag means that no one except for a level 43 can edit
          this zone at all
!ASTRAL - this flag will be used to block teleportation type spells
          it is currently already added to teleport and recall

Option &MM&n is for zone levels, you will be given another menu as well
This range of levels can be from 0 to 100, or set to -1 which means 
that any level can enter the zone.  The menu you see when choosing
this option presents you with 3 options, 1-min level, 2-max level,
3-unsets all the level restrictions and makes it like using -1

&YALL ZONES MUST BE EDITED AND ADJUSTED TO USE THESE NEW FLAGS.&n
&YPlease zedit your zone and set the CLOSED flag if it is not linked
to the game yet, and to GRID if it is linked.  Also please set the 
level restrictions as soon as possible.&n
&C**There is a slight bug with this..if you set your levels and save
your zone and re-zedit it you will notice that the levels you set
have reset to 0 to 0.  If you set up your levels and leave the
zone and come back, the levels you set will still be correct..
work in progress!&n

&Mareas command&n
This will get a bit confusing, but over time will be second nature!

This command basically lists out all zones with the GRID flag set
as well as showing the level restrictions for each zone.  Players
can also restrict what level ranges they want to veiw, see the
following examples:

areas      - lists all areas
areas 24   - list all areas where 24 is in its level range
areas -10  - list areas in the level range of 0 through 10
areas 15-  - list areas starting with min-level 15 and up
areas 5-12 - list areas where min level is 5 and max level is 12

Some areas may "overlap" eachother due to the level ranges, an example
would be zone1 is level ranged 1-3, zone2 is level ranged 2-4.
zone2 would show up red because it overlaps when using areas 1-4

&MOther commands&n  

zlock <zone #>  - locks that zone #
zlock all       - locks all zones with the GRID flag
zlock all all   - locks all zones in the game
zlock list      - lists all locked zones

  This command is useable by builders for their own zones where they
  are listed as one of the builders.  Level 43 gods can use this on 
  ANY zone in the game.

zunlock <zone #> - unlocks that zone #
zunlock all      - unlocks all zones
zunlock list     - lists all unlocked zones

  This command is useable by builders for their own zones where they
  are listed as one of the builders.  Level 43 gods can use this on
  ANY zone in the game.


&R**Wiz set command change**&n

Level 43's can now set <player> saves
This will remove the said players equipment and reset their save
vs spells/petri etc to 0
*eq is removed to avoid messing anything up on the reset, they can 
 wear all afterwards!
