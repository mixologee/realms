New Commands

We apologize in advance for not keeping you all informed with some of our
newest commands.  As we add things we sometimes get brainfarts and forget
to notify you about what we are adding.

Well here is a short list of things we have added since the last news file.

affects        - shows you what spells you are current affected by
worth          - shows you how much gold you have amassed
mount          - allows you to mount a tamed beast
tame           - spell - attempts to tame a beast
dismount       - dismounts your current mount
gamestats      - shows some information about Kuvias statistics
binding        - we can now bind eq to a specific player, making it 
                 useless to everyone else until unbound


Other tidbits that you may/may not notice as we go along.

Mob Intelligence module is in and about 30% completed, you may notice 
that some mobs will randomly talk, cast defensive spells on themselves,
cast offensively against you and generally interact with the game. 
More to come on this as it gets completed.

Regen equipment - there are some new flags in place to allow some 
                  equipment to help regen mana/mvs/hps faster

Eq Procs - Some procs are in place on some equipment, most of which
           is not out there for public use, but the groundwork is 
           in and ready for proccing eq, both weapons and worn

And as always, various updates, bug fixes and general all around
work is being done as time permits.  Bluntmaster and I are working
as hard as we can as we are trying to get Kuvia up and running and
open to the public as soon as possible!

As always, Enjoy!!
