&G ALIAS ALIASES

&WUsage: alias [alias name] [command]

&WAn alias is a single command used to represent one or more other commands.
The ALIAS command can be used to manipulate your character's aliases.  Type
ALIAS alone to see a list of your currently defined aliases.

  > alias

Type ALIAS <alias name> <command> to create a new alias.  The alias name must
be one word.  The command can be any string.  Aliases may not be nested or
used recursively.  Any command may be overridden by an alias (other than the
ALIAS command itself, of course).

  > alias gbb get bread bag
  > alias gac get all corpse

Type ALIAS <alias-name> to delete an alias that has already been defined.

  > alias gbb

A semicolon (";") can be used to define multiple actions to be taken with
a single alias.

  > alias eat get bread bag; eat bread

Note that the 'eat' contained within the eat alias is interpreted as the MUD's
internal eat command; aliases may not be nested or used recursively.  The
variables $1, $2, ... $9 may be used to represent arguments given with
an alias.

Examples:

  > alias killem cast 'fireball' $1; cast 'harm' $2
  > killem fido mage

Would cast fireball on fido, followed by casting harm on mage.  Variables
may be used repeatedly and in any order:

  > alias helpem cast 'heal' $1; cast 'bless' $1; cast 'armor' $1

The special variable $* represents the entire input line after an alias:

  > alias tr tell rasmussen $*
  > tr hi there, how are you today?
  You tell Rasmussen, 'hi there, how are you today?'

&G ANSI COLOR

&WUsage: color [off | sparse | normal | complete]

If you have a color-capable terminal and wish to see useful color-coding
of information, use the COLOR command to set the level of coloring you see.

  > color off
  This command disables all color.

  > color sparse
  > color normal
  > color complete

These three commands turn color on to various levels.  Experiment to see
which level suits your personal taste.

'color' with no argument will display your current color level.

Using color will slow down the speed at which you see messages VERY slightly.
The effect is more noticeable on slower connections.  Even if you have
color turned on, non-colorized messages will not be slowed down at all.

&G DEAD DEATH DYING

Death &Win most cultures is a sensitive subject. Everyone dies, and in the
game people must also die. If your reading this because you just died, 
please allow me to simply say "HAHAHA YOUR DEAD!!!". <ahem> anyway, when
you die you will be transported to the realm of the dead. In order to
restore yourself back to life you must collect souls = currentlevel. When 
you have gathered enough souls you must find the necromancer and blaze in
his room. You will then be able to use your mortal body again. This is 
usually a good time to peel your sweaty naked ass off of the leather 
swivel chair, and go grab a snack, beverage, and drain the main vein(for
you ladies out there, powder yer pretty lil nose's) or just give yer eye's
a quick 5'er. If your like me though, you'll simply hold it till your
bladders gonna bust while in cpk, and your so cottonmouthed ya can't even
talk to tell someone your retinas have burned out 5 minutes ago from 
staring to long at the computer screen.

your opponent during &Gcombat&W. The higher your &Ghitroll &Wis , the

&G HOUSES

&WA house entails two things:
Access control and crash protection.  Only you and your guests will be allowed
to enter the &Ghouse&W.  Your &Ghouse &Wwill be crash-saved every minute. You
can force your &Ghouse &Wto save by typing '&Gsave&W' while standing in your 
&Ghouse&W. In the event of a crash, the objects in your &Ghouse &Was of the 
last crash-save will be loaded back into your &Ghouse &Wwhen the MUD reboots. 
Also, if you own a &Ghouse&W, and quit from the game while standing in your 
&Ghouse&W, you will be loaded into your &Ghouse &Wnext time you enter the game,
provided there was not a crash in between the two events.
     Guests of your &Ghouse &Wcan be defined using the &GHOUSE command&W.  See 
&GHOUSE &Wfor more information.
     The main reason to have a &Ghouse&W, is simply to have ones own little 
spot in the game. You decorate it, however you want it to look. It's your spot 
and noone can force ya to make it look a certain way. As usual the game's main 
rule is in effect, so absolutly no nazi or even nazi-esque shit will be 
tolerated. Hate is pretty much the only thing that will get you purged around
here.
     Houses almost make a great place to store your eq. simply drop your gear 
in your house and it will stick around till you're ready to use it again. Home
owners can also make use of the &Ggohome &Wcommand. This will magically 
transport you to your home from anywhere in the game, except &GNPK &Wand &GCPK&W.
    Talk to &GTek &Wfor more info or check out the real estate office in The 
City.

&G LINK

&WA lot of players have problems with their links to the game.  This can be
very hazardous to your health in the middle of a battle, of course.

 I. If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee each
    time someone attempts to hit you.  If you manage to flee, then you
    will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until you
    reconnect to the game.

II. If your link jams (freezes), you have a problem.  The only solution we
    can give is that you break your link as quickly as possible.  By
    breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.

    Do not try to get out of a fight by breaking link.  You will be not
    reimbursed for any experience or equipment if you purposefully
    cut your link.&n

&G SHOPS

Shops &Ware places where the adventurer may purchase &Gequipment &Wfor his/her quests,
and where he/she may &Gsell &Whis treasure if he/she should manage to survive the perils
with his/her life and sanity intact.  Many &Gshops &Wtrade only in a specific type of
merchandise.  Thus, a baker may well refuse to buy your armor, even if it is
of high quality!

To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire &Ginventory &Wof a &Gshop &Wby
murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The shopkeepers are 
often rugged, capable men; roughened by years of trading and, indeed, surviving
in a world where the only safe prospect is death in the end.

&G CIRCLE CIRCLEMUD CREDITS
                    &CC  I  R  C  L  E  M  U  D     3  .  0

&WCircleMUD was developed from DikuMud (Gamma 0.0) by Jeremy "Ras" Elson at
Johns Hopkins University's Department of Computer Science.  All code unique
to CircleMUD is protected under a copyright by the Trustees of the Johns
Hopkins University.

Many, many people contributed to CircleMUD in one way or another throughout
the course of its development.  Although it's impossible for me to remember
them all, I'd like to extend special thanks to certain people:

  -- Jeff Fink and George Greer, for submitting a veritable mountain of
     excellent code.
  -- Chris Epler and Chris Herringshaw for extensive beta-testing and bug
     reporting.
  -- Furry (Alex Fletcher), for single-handedly managing Circle's world files.
  -- Fred Merkel, Ryan Watkins, Jay Levino, and Sharon Goza, for other
     code and area submissions.
  -- Jean-Jack Riethoven for porting the code to the Amiga, David Carver
     for porting it to OS/2, and Jack Patton and Steffen Haeuser for the
     Amiga port.
  -- Bill Bogstad and Tim Stearns for allowing Circle to exist at JHU.
  -- The DikuMud folk, and the good old WhatMUD implementors Dave & Justin,
     for starting the ball rolling.
  -- Bryan Jolson, Steven Lacher, Cat Stanton, and Naved Surve, for being 
     there in the very early days of Circle's development.
  -- Sharon, Ben, Erica, Aly, and Josh, for keeping me sane.
  -- Jules (hamotek sheli) for being the greatest.

...plus everyone else in the Circle community who has submitted material!
Thanks everyone!

&G OASIS

&WOasisOLC is the name given to a set of on line editing tools that can be
used by authorized players to examine, change and create the various world
entities that make up the Mud environment.  It is referred to as "on line"
creation because it allows people to create and edit things while the mud
is running, or on line.  This is opposed to the traditional method of editing the various text files that comprise the mud "world" using various 
off-line editors (typically vi or emacs), and the restarting the mud so 
that the updated files are reloaded.

&cCategories of &GOasis &cCommands
&C----------------------------&W

1&C)  &WCommands to examine the existing mud operation.  These are the [x]list
    commands, that can be used to view a range of world objects, and give
    a summary of their descriptions.  The actual commands are:
    &Gmlist &C- &WList Mobiles               &Gslist &C- &WList Shops
    &Golist &C- &WList Objects               &Gzlist &C- &WList Zones
    &Grlist &C- &WList Rooms

2&C)  &WCommands to change or create entities and mud operation values.  The
    commands are:
    &Gaedit &W- Actions (&Gsocials&W) editor   &Gredit &W- Room editor
    &Gcedit &W- Configuration editor       &Gsedit &W- &GShop &Weditor
    &Gmedit &W- Mobile editor              &Gtedit &W- Text file editor
    &Goedit &W- Object editor              &Gzedit &W- &GZone &Weditor

3&C)  &WMiscellaneous commands.
    &Gbuildwalk &W- Create rooms by walking around
    &Gdig       &W- Open exits between two rooms
    &Grclone    &W- Create a copy of a room
    &Gsaveall   &W- Writes al outstanding changes to disk

&cUsing the Editing Commands
&C--------------------------&W

All of the edit commands are menu driven.  See &GOASIS-EDIT &Wfor general
instructions on how the menu interface works.

&cGranting Access to &GOasis &cCommands
&C---------------------------------&W

Access to the &GOasis &Wcommands are controlled through a number of means.
Of course, the master command list (in interpreter.c) specifies the 
minimum &Glevel &Wfor a player to call the command.  This is typically set
to either LVL_BUILDER, or LVL_GOD.  A few commands are restricted to the 
implementor. 
A player can always edit a &Gzone &Wand its contents if their name is in 
the &Gzone &Wbuilders list (see &GZEDIT &Wfor more information).  Finally,
a player may be granted &GOLC &Wrights to a specific &Gzone &Wby means of 
the "set" command, using "set <player> &Golc &W<&Gzone&W>".

The implementor has unfettered access to all &GOasis &Wcommands.

&cExternal Documentation

&G OASIS-EDIT

&WThe OasisOLC edit programs make use of a menu interface, and each of the
various commands has a similar appearance.  Each attribute of the thing
you are editing is listed, with a menu number against it.  These numbers
start from the number 1, run through the digits to 9, then use the letters
A onwards.  You enter the number (or letter) corresponding to the item you
wish to change.

Some menu items will lead to sub-menus, for example setting various bit
fields.

In general, the letter "Q" will quit (with the option to save) the menu
level you are currently at, although some sub-menus use the number "0"
to leave the menu.

&cTypes of Menu Items
&C-------------------&W

1&C)  &WSingle value items.  These correspond to attributes that have a single
    value or a simple list.  For example, a room name, an object's weight,
    or the list of aliases for a mobile.  Enter the value(s) and press the
    return key.

2&C)  &WLong text fields.  This corresponds to a multi-line text string, such
    as a room's description.  This makes use of the "enhanced edit" text
    editor.  Use the "/h" command in the editor to see the various options.

3&C)  &WMulti-value fields.  This is a menu item where you have to enter 
    several values, such as an object's value flags, where there can be 
    up to four values that you have to enter.  Each value will have its 
    own prompt, so enter the value as directed by the prompt, and press 
    the return key.

4&C)  &WBit string fields.  This menu item goes to a sub-menu, with all of the 
    possible bit values listed.  You can select as many values as you wish,
    with each menu number on this sub-menu toggling its corresponding flag
    on and off.  Use the menu item "0" once you have set all the flags you
    require to return to the top menu.

5&C)  &WMultiple choice fields.  This is where the attribute has one of a 
    number of possible values, such as an object's type or a room's sector
    type. The sub-menu will list all the possible values, so to choose the
    value you want, enter the menu item number that corresponds to the 
    particular choice you want. This is unlike the bit string field, in 
    that once you make a choice, that value is recorded and you are 
    returned to the upper menu.

6&C)  &WSub menus. Selecting this menu option takes you to a sub-menu where a
    new set of menu items are listed. Once you have finished working at 
    this sub-menu level, generally 0 or Q will return you to the 
    upper menu.

&cSaving Your Changes
&C-------------------&W

If you have changed the thing you are working on in any way, taking the 
"Q" option from the top-most menu will save the object, if you respond
with a "Y" at the save object prompt.

           restart the MUD.

DIE        Kill the autorun script; the MUD will not reboot until autorun is

STRING

Usage: string <type> <name> <field> [<string> | <keyword>]

For changing the text-strings associated with objects and characters.  The
format is:

Type is either 'obj' or 'char'.

Field is one of the following(the names may be abbreviated):

Name                  (the call-name of an obj/char - kill giant)
Short                 (for inventory lists (obj's) and actions (char's))
Long                  (for when obj/character is seen in room)
Title                 (for players)
Description           (For look at.  For obj's, must be followed by a keyword)
Delete-description    (only for obj's. Must be followed by keyword)

Where a string is expected as the last argument, a newline will make you enter
a string mode, and the game will prompt you for new lines to the string until
you exceed the maximum length for the string or you end a line with a '@'.

Mobiles and objects currently cannot be strung.
