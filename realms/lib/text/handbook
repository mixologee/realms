&RTo all immorts:&n

&GThe admin of &YThe Realms of Kuvia&G are well aware that alot of you&n
&Gmay be from Medievia(c).  Now we all know how condescending the gods are&n
&Gover there, and this handbook is here to tell you that this isn't what&n
&Gwe want over here.&n

&GPlayers will always do stupid things time and time again, and I know it&n
&Gcan be frustrating, but they are still people and deserve to be treated&n
&Gwith the same respect you would show another immortal.  If someone is &n
&Gbeing a total ass, by all means discipline them, annoy them some, but&n
&RDO NOT&G freeze them.  If you think they need to be frozen or purged,&n 
&Gpass that information along to the implementors and let them handle it.&n

&GIf they ask questions, whether insanely stupid or not, please do your &n
&Gbest to answer them respectfully.  Stupidity and inexperience are two&n
&Gdifferent things.  Each is difficult to tollerate, but we should do our&n
&Gbest to do so.  If they keep asking the same question over and over, and&n
&Git seems more like being stupid than inexperienced, warn them they are &n
&Gcrossing the line and will be punished if they do not stop.  If it seems&n
&Git is due to inexperience, please try to work with this person to help&n
&Gthem understand.  You get to make the first line judgement calls, you are&n
&Gour eyes and ears on the game as we cannot always be here and cannot &n
&Galways be paying attention while here.&n

&GThis is our game to mold and grow, we do not want to bring over the &n
&Gexperiences from the other games and pass them along to this one.  The&n
&Gchoices you make can and/or will affect how this game looks to the players&n
&Gthat log on. So do us a favor and be a god of &YThe Realms of Kuvia&G, not&n
&Ga god of a former mud you've played.&n

&RNOTE:&G Purges must be approved by Bluntmaster at this point.  If you feel&n
       &G that someone deserves this, freeze them, and notifiy him right away.&n
       &G Please remember that &YThe Realms of Kuvia&G has no social morality&n
       &G and/or responsibility, so cursing, sexual content, drug references&n
       &G are legal at this time.  Anyone can say anything on any channel so&n
       &G long that it isn't oppressive nazi bullshit! (This meaning any form&n
       &G of racism, sexism and other ism's)  A joke is a joke, so make sure&n
       &G to feel out the situation before making the final judgement.&n

&W--------------------------------------------------------------------------&n
&Gfor example:&n

&Glets say charly murphy and tyree are pk'in each other. Charly stabs tyree&n
&Gand tyree calls him a fuckin faggot. This is not considered nazi bullshit, &n
&Gtyree is just pissed cause he got stabbed. &n

&Gnow lets say tyree is standing in the middle of The City and shouting stuff&n
&Glike kill all the faggots and burn the jews. see the difference?&n

&W--------------------------------------------------------------------------&n

&GEven player bashing is acceptable to a degree. Let it go untill its &n
&Gobviously gone to far, then tell the offending party that they are starting to&n
&Gpush their luck and they better mellow out quickly before action is taken.&n

&GBasically when it comes to disipline, its our job to say "hey thats outta &n
&Gline" or "hey thats goin to far"&n

&GAs always have fun&n
