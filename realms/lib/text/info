with them. Here we go...

     You start out as a &GMage&W, a &GWarrior&W, a &GThief&W, or a &GCleric&W. Each class
has a &Gguild&W. &GGuilds &Ware where ya &Gpractice &Wyour skills and &Gspells&W. To be 
able to &Gpractice &Wyou have to have practice points. These are earned by 
leveling. To &Glevel &Wyou need &Gexperience &Wpoints. For &Gexp &Wyou need to do one
thing, kill kill kill kill. 

     Don't run around naked. It's tastless(unless yer a hot chick) and it
hurts when you get attacked. Find or buy some equipment. &GEq &Wloads on mobs
aka: monsters and non player characters. 

&WAs a mortal you must &Geat &Wand &Gdrink&W. If you don't it causes serious
problems. 
     Stay out of npk and cpk untill you know what it is.
