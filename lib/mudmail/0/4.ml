Zone 146 has the !ASTRAL flag set under ZEDIT, this flag stops ALL transportation magic within the whole zone.  Remove that flag and the specific rooms should be the only ones affected.. if that doesnt work lemme know.

Alright, I did that and it is working, thanks. I thought !ASTRAL stopped people from going to The Mist. Perhaps there should be another flag for that?
