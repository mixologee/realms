Subj: mysql--need to reinstall again!
Body:
Ok so, we cant use mysql with circlemud atm cause we dont have the header files associated with mysql.
I've been looking around online and apparently you have to install it like this?
sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient15-dev
apparently yo uneed the dev stuff that has all the header files.. less you know where to get em.. 
they should be located under /usr/local/mysql i think
