&WCLASSES&n

&GThere are four major classes on &YThe Realms of Kuvia&G, each has its own
&Gspecial abilities that only that class can use until you &WRECLASS&G.  The 
&Gfour major classes are: &WMAGE&G, &WCLERIC&G, &WTHIEF&G, and &WWARRIOR&G.&n
&GBriefly stated, warriors are battle ready characters, known for their strength and
&Gpower in combat.  Thieves are cunning and fast, known for their dexterity and 
&Gability to steal items.  Mages are powerful offensive spell casters, though they
&Glack some of the bulk as the meleeing classes, they have spells to help them
&Gcounter many offensive attacks.  Clerics are the healers, they can mend your 
&Gwounds, cure your diseases and create food and water for you and your party.
&GEach class has its own advantages and disadvantages, and grouping with
&Gother members of other classes helps greatly in battles.

&WGROUPS&n

&GGroups are high powered formations of players.  Creatures of higher levels
&Gare much more easily defeatable when you are grouping, and it is advised
&Gthat if you plan on taking on some of the greatest creatures in the game, 
&Ggrouping is a must!  When you are groups, the damage you take will
&Gdepend on where you lie within the group.  If you are in the back row,
&Gthere is a greater chance of the damage you recieve being minimal to
&Gnone at all, however, if you are in the front row, prepare for the brunt of 
&Gthe damage to lie on your shoulders.  Grouping also helps players gain
&G&WEXPERIENCE&G faster and help gain &WLEVELS&G quicker.

&WSKILLS & SPELLS&n

&GEach &WCLASS&G on &YThe Realms of Kuvia&G has it's own set of skills and/or
&Gspells.  As you level, your character can gain new &WSKILLS&G and/or &WSPELLS&G.
&GAs you learn these new abilities you become more powerful.  To learn these new 
&Gabilities you must go to your class &WGUILD&G.  Guilds allow you to &WPRACTICE&G
&Gyour new skills and/or spells.  You gain &WPRACTICE POINTS&G by leveling.
&GEach time you practice your new abilities your skill level in them will raise up.
&GEach practice you do will take a random number of practice points from you
&Gand apply them to your skill and/or spell.

&WFOOD & DRINK&n

&GWhile in your travels you may encounter messages that say that you
&Gare hungry or thirsty, this means that you need to &WEAT&G or &WDRINK&G 
&Gsomething before your life starts to deterioriate and the rate at which you
&Gregain your &WMOVEMENT&G, &WHITPOINTS&G, and &WMANAPOINTS&G will slow.
&GClerics can create both food and drink for you, or you can buy waterskins or
&Gjugs and food at the local stores in the major cities.

&WCLANS&n

&GOnce you  have experienced much of the game, you may want to join or
&Gcreate a &WCLAN&G.  Creating a clan costs a huge amount of gold and you
&Gmust have at least 5 players willing to join your clan at its creation or it will
&Gbe denied.  Joining a clan is much easier, as it has already been created and
&Gyou may only need to pay a small fee to be enrolled if accepted.  Each clan has 
&Gtheir own private channel to talk on and you can even telepath each other as
&Glong as you are in the clan.  To become a member of a clan, you must talk to 
&Gthe clan leaders and ask them if you can join.

&WHOUSES&n

&GIf you have gotten yourself a good amount of wealth in the game, you may 
&Gwish to buy your own little property in one of the major cities.  &WHOUSES&G
&Gare the best way to do so.  For a modest fee, you can purchase your own 
&Ghouse, along with your own room descriptions.  Once you own your own
&Ghome you have the ability to use the &WGOHOME&w and &WHOUSE&G commands.
&GThese commands will allow you to instantly go to your house if you are in the
&Gcity in which your house resides.  The other command allows you to set who is
&Gand isn't a guest in your house.  Only guests may enter your house.

&GTalk to any implementor about how to purchase your own home.

&WZONES&n

&GThere are many zones in the game, and a very vast wilderness.  You can
&Gexplore these zones by walking around the wilderness to find them, or by
&Gusing &WCRYSTALGATES&G to transport you to some of them.  Using the 
&G&WSHOW ZONES&G command lists out all of our current zones, both ones you
&Gcan enter and ones you cannot.  Each zone has its own experience to give 
&Gyou and can also help equip you with some better equipment.

&WPROFESSIONS&n

&GThere are currently 8 different professions you can learn if you want
&Gsome variety in the game.  Each one has its own set of tools needed to
&Gwork them, and the items you get from them can be combined together
&Gsometimes to create your own items.  You can create your own items in
&Gthe forge.  Items you create can be used as weapons or worn as armor.
&GAll items you create will not be better than items you can get from
&Gsome of the higher creatures in the game, but it helps you if you get
&Gstuck without some equipment and need it.


&WMISC&n

&GTo get some extra information about the game you can use any one of
&Gthe following commands: &WGAMESTATS&G, &WSHOW ZONES&G.  There
&Gare many other &WCOMMANDS&G available to you within the game, simply
&Gtype commands to see them.  

&GAs a general tip, read the bulliten boards often, don't be afraid to ask both
&Gplayers and gods for information, don't be afraid to explore new areas, read
&Ghelp files on anything you may be confused on, and in general have fun!
