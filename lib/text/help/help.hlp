have the same script as the original, rather than any script normally assigned 
to the new, and no load trigger will be executed.

   Mobs - The hit points, max hit points, position, gold, and experience value 
will remain those of the original mob but all other statistics and descriptions 
will be those of the new mob. (The new mob can be made to have all of its normal 
statistics by using a negative vnum.) Only mobiles may use this command (naturally).

   Objects - Based on the vnum argument supplied. The four basic values will 
remain those of the original mob but all other statistics and descriptions will 
be those of the new object. The transformation is permanent, additional 
transformations may be performed. No message regarding the transformation is 
sent to the room. The new object will have the same script as the originating 
object, rather than any script normally assigned to the new object, and no 
load trigger will be executed.

&G ALIAS ALIASES

&WUsage: alias [alias name] [command]

&WAn alias is a single command used to represent one or more other commands.
The ALIAS command can be used to manipulate your character's aliases.  Type
ALIAS alone to see a list of your currently defined aliases.

  > alias

Type ALIAS <alias name> <command> to create a new alias.  The alias name must
be one word.  The command can be any string.  Aliases may not be nested or
used recursively.  Any command may be overridden by an alias (other than the
ALIAS command itself, of course).

  > alias gbb get bread bag
  > alias gac get all corpse

Type ALIAS <alias-name> to delete an alias that has already been defined.

  > alias gbb

A semicolon (";") can be used to define multiple actions to be taken with
a single alias.

  > alias eat get bread bag; eat bread

Note that the 'eat' contained within the eat alias is interpreted as the MUD's
internal eat command; aliases may not be nested or used recursively.  The
variables $1, $2, ... $9 may be used to represent arguments given with
an alias.

Examples:

  > alias killem cast 'fireball' $1; cast 'harm' $2
  > killem fido mage

Would cast fireball on fido, followed by casting harm on mage.  Variables
may be used repeatedly and in any order:

  > alias helpem cast 'heal' $1; cast 'bless' $1; cast 'armor' $1

The special variable $* represents the entire input line after an alias:

  > alias tr tell rasmussen $*
  > tr hi there, how are you today?
  You tell Rasmussen, 'hi there, how are you today?'

&G ANSI COLOR

&WUsage: color [off | sparse | normal | complete]

If you have a color-capable terminal and wish to see useful color-coding
of information, use the COLOR command to set the level of coloring you see.

  > color off
  This command disables all color.

  > color sparse
  > color normal
  > color complete

These three commands turn color on to various levels.  Experiment to see
which level suits your personal taste.

'color' with no argument will display your current color level.

Using color will slow down the speed at which you see messages VERY slightly.
The effect is more noticeable on slower connections.  Even if you have
color turned on, non-colorized messages will not be slowed down at all.

&G DEAD DEATH DYING

Death &Win most cultures is a sensitive subject. Everyone dies, and in the
game people must also die. If your reading this because you just died, 
please allow me to simply say "HAHAHA YOUR DEAD!!!". <ahem> anyway, when
you die you will be transported to the realm of the dead. In order to
restore yourself back to life you must collect souls = currentlevel. When 
you have gathered enough souls you must find the necromancer and blaze in
his room. You will then be able to use your mortal body again. This is 
usually a good time to peel your sweaty naked ass off of the leather 
swivel chair, and go grab a snack, beverage, and drain the main vein(for
you ladies out there, powder yer pretty lil nose's) or just give yer eye's
a quick 5'er. If your like me though, you'll simply hold it till your
bladders gonna bust while in cpk, and your so cottonmouthed ya can't even

&G BLOOD
&cEvery time you kill another player, you get blood on your hands. The
amount of blood varies depending on the level of the players. If you
are a higher level than the target, you will get more blood than if you
are equal or lower level. This really only has an affect currently on
outlaws. If you have blood and are not an outlaw, this will have no real
affect on you as of yet.

&G BOARDS

&WBulletin boards are the forum of inter-player communication on the MUD.
There are different bulletin boards for different purposes -- for example,
a standard mortal board, a board for immortals, a board for fun "social"
messages, etc.  Naturally, not all players may be allowed to read all
types of boards.

Type "&GLOOK BOARD&W" to see the messages already posted on a board.  Type
"&GWRITE &W<subject>" to post a message to a board; terminate a message with
a '@' as the first character on a line.  Type "&GREAD &W<number>" to read a
post.  Type "&GREMOVE &W<number>" to remove your own messages.

Example:

  > &Glook &Wat &Gboard
  &W> &Gwrite &WAm I using these boards correctly?
  [writes the message; terminates with a '@']
  > &Glook &Wat &Gboard
  &W> &Gread &W6

they want to. If you lose your gear, don't bother asking for it back, it

&G GUILD

&WThe Guildhouse is the place where mortals may go to escape the troubles and

&G HITROLL

Hitroll &Wis the number The Game uses to determine whether or not you hit
your opponent during &Gcombat&W. The higher your &Ghitroll &Wis , the 
higher your chances to actually connect. &GClerics &Wand &Gmages &Wtend to
rely less heavily on this than &Gwarriors &Wand &Gthieves&W.

&G HOUSES

&WA house entails two things:
Access control and crash protection.  Only you and your guests will be allowed
to enter the &Ghouse&W.  Your &Ghouse &Wwill be crash-saved every minute. You
can force your &Ghouse &Wto save by typing '&Gsave&W' while standing in your 
&Ghouse&W. In the event of a crash, the objects in your &Ghouse &Was of the 
last crash-save will be loaded back into your &Ghouse &Wwhen the MUD reboots. 
Also, if you own a &Ghouse&W, and quit from the game while standing in your 
&Ghouse&W, you will be loaded into your &Ghouse &Wnext time you enter the game,
provided there was not a crash in between the two events.
     Guests of your &Ghouse &Wcan be defined using the &GHOUSE command&W.  See 
&GHOUSE &Wfor more information.
     The main reason to have a &Ghouse&W, is simply to have ones own little 
spot in the game. You decorate it, however you want it to look. It's your spot 
and noone can force ya to make it look a certain way. As usual the game's main 
rule is in effect, so absolutly no nazi or even nazi-esque shit will be 
tolerated. Hate is pretty much the only thing that will get you purged around
here.
     Houses almost make a great place to store your eq. simply drop your gear 
in your house and it will stick around till you're ready to use it again. Home
owners can also make use of the &Ggohome &Wcommand. This will magically 
transport you to your home from anywhere in the game, except &GNPK &Wand &GCPK&W.
    Talk to &GTek &Wfor more info or check out the real estate office in The 
City.

&G LINK

&WA lot of players have problems with their links to the game.  This can be
very hazardous to your health in the middle of a battle, of course.

 I. If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee each
    time someone attempts to hit you.  If you manage to flee, then you
    will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until you
    reconnect to the game.

II. If your link jams (freezes), you have a problem.  The only solution we
    can give is that you break your link as quickly as possible.  By
    breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.

    Do not try to get out of a fight by breaking link.  You will be not
    reimbursed for any experience or equipment if you purposefully
    cut your link.&n

&G "MAGIC USER" WIZARD MAGE

&G SHOPS

Shops &Ware places where the adventurer may purchase &Gequipment &Wfor his/her quests,
and where he/she may &Gsell &Whis treasure if he/she should manage to survive the perils
with his/her life and sanity intact.  Many &Gshops &Wtrade only in a specific type of
merchandise.  Thus, a baker may well refuse to buy your armor, even if it is
of high quality!

To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire &Ginventory &Wof a &Gshop &Wby
murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The shopkeepers are 
often rugged, capable men; roughened by years of trading and, indeed, surviving
in a world where the only safe prospect is death in the end.

&G WARRIOR 

&WWarriors are known to have more strength than the average player.  This makes
them better at hand-to-hand-&Gcombat&W, as they possess skills of violence and
fighting unequaled by the members of any other class.  However, they lack the
ability to use magic of any sort.

You can improve your skills by using the &Gpractice command&W.

Skills available to warriors:

&Gkick&W, &Grescue&W, &Gtrack&W, &Gbash&W, &Gsecond attack&W, &GStomp&W, &GThird attack&W

&G CIRCLE CIRCLEMUD CREDITS
                    &CC  I  R  C  L  E  M  U  D     3  .  0

&WCircleMUD was developed from DikuMud (Gamma 0.0) by Jeremy "Ras" Elson at
Johns Hopkins University's Department of Computer Science.  All code unique
to CircleMUD is protected under a copyright by the Trustees of the Johns
Hopkins University.

Many, many people contributed to CircleMUD in one way or another throughout
the course of its development.  Although it's impossible for me to remember
them all, I'd like to extend special thanks to certain people:

  -- Jeff Fink and George Greer, for submitting a veritable mountain of
     excellent code.
  -- Chris Epler and Chris Herringshaw for extensive beta-testing and bug
     reporting.
  -- Furry (Alex Fletcher), for single-handedly managing Circle's world files.
  -- Fred Merkel, Ryan Watkins, Jay Levino, and Sharon Goza, for other
     code and area submissions.
  -- Jean-Jack Riethoven for porting the code to the Amiga, David Carver
     for porting it to OS/2, and Jack Patton and Steffen Haeuser for the
     Amiga port.
  -- Bill Bogstad and Tim Stearns for allowing Circle to exist at JHU.
  -- The DikuMud folk, and the good old WhatMUD implementors Dave & Justin,
     for starting the ball rolling.
  -- Bryan Jolson, Steven Lacher, Cat Stanton, and Naved Surve, for being 
     there in the very early days of Circle's development.
  -- Sharon, Ben, Erica, Aly, and Josh, for keeping me sane.
  -- Jules (hamotek sheli) for being the greatest.

...plus everyone else in the Circle community who has submitted material!
Thanks everyone!

&G OASIS

&WOasisOLC is the name given to a set of on line editing tools that can be
used by authorized players to examine, change and create the various world
entities that make up the Mud environment.  It is referred to as "on line"
creation because it allows people to create and edit things while the mud
is running, or on line.  This is opposed to the traditional method of editing the various text files that comprise the mud "world" using various 
off-line editors (typically vi or emacs), and the restarting the mud so 
that the updated files are reloaded.

&cCategories of &GOasis &cCommands
&C----------------------------&W

1&C)  &WCommands to examine the existing mud operation.  These are the [x]list
    commands, that can be used to view a range of world objects, and give
    a summary of their descriptions.  The actual commands are:
    &Gmlist &C- &WList Mobiles               &Gslist &C- &WList Shops
    &Golist &C- &WList Objects               &Gzlist &C- &WList Zones
    &Grlist &C- &WList Rooms

2&C)  &WCommands to change or create entities and mud operation values.  The
    commands are:
    &Gaedit &W- Actions (&Gsocials&W) editor   &Gredit &W- Room editor
    &Gcedit &W- Configuration editor       &Gsedit &W- &GShop &Weditor
    &Gmedit &W- Mobile editor              &Gtedit &W- Text file editor
    &Goedit &W- Object editor              &Gzedit &W- &GZone &Weditor

3&C)  &WMiscellaneous commands.
    &Gbuildwalk &W- Create rooms by walking around
    &Gdig       &W- Open exits between two rooms
    &Grclone    &W- Create a copy of a room
    &Gsaveall   &W- Writes al outstanding changes to disk

&cUsing the Editing Commands
&C--------------------------&W

All of the edit commands are menu driven.  See &GOASIS-EDIT &Wfor general
instructions on how the menu interface works.

&cGranting Access to &GOasis &cCommands
&C---------------------------------&W

Access to the &GOasis &Wcommands are controlled through a number of means.
Of course, the master command list (in interpreter.c) specifies the 
minimum &Glevel &Wfor a player to call the command.  This is typically set
to either LVL_BUILDER, or LVL_GOD.  A few commands are restricted to the 
implementor. 
A player can always edit a &Gzone &Wand its contents if their name is in 
the &Gzone &Wbuilders list (see &GZEDIT &Wfor more information).  Finally,
a player may be granted &GOLC &Wrights to a specific &Gzone &Wby means of 
the "set" command, using "set <player> &Golc &W<&Gzone&W>".

The implementor has unfettered access to all &GOasis &Wcommands.

&cExternal Documentation

&G OASIS-EDIT

&WThe OasisOLC edit programs make use of a menu interface, and each of the
various commands has a similar appearance.  Each attribute of the thing
you are editing is listed, with a menu number against it.  These numbers
start from the number 1, run through the digits to 9, then use the letters
A onwards.  You enter the number (or letter) corresponding to the item you
wish to change.

Some menu items will lead to sub-menus, for example setting various bit
fields.

In general, the letter "Q" will quit (with the option to save) the menu
level you are currently at, although some sub-menus use the number "0"
to leave the menu.

&cTypes of Menu Items
&C-------------------&W

1&C)  &WSingle value items.  These correspond to attributes that have a single
    value or a simple list.  For example, a room name, an object's weight,
    or the list of aliases for a mobile.  Enter the value(s) and press the
    return key.

2&C)  &WLong text fields.  This corresponds to a multi-line text string, such
    as a room's description.  This makes use of the "enhanced edit" text
    editor.  Use the "/h" command in the editor to see the various options.

3&C)  &WMulti-value fields.  This is a menu item where you have to enter 
    several values, such as an object's value flags, where there can be 
    up to four values that you have to enter.  Each value will have its 
    own prompt, so enter the value as directed by the prompt, and press 
    the return key.

4&C)  &WBit string fields.  This menu item goes to a sub-menu, with all of the 
    possible bit values listed.  You can select as many values as you wish,
    with each menu number on this sub-menu toggling its corresponding flag
    on and off.  Use the menu item "0" once you have set all the flags you
    require to return to the top menu.

5&C)  &WMultiple choice fields.  This is where the attribute has one of a 
    number of possible values, such as an object's type or a room's sector
    type. The sub-menu will list all the possible values, so to choose the
    value you want, enter the menu item number that corresponds to the 
    particular choice you want. This is unlike the bit string field, in 
    that once you make a choice, that value is recorded and you are 
    returned to the upper menu.

6&C)  &WSub menus. Selecting this menu option takes you to a sub-menu where a
    new set of menu items are listed. Once you have finished working at 
    this sub-menu level, generally 0 or Q will return you to the 
    upper menu.

&cSaving Your Changes
&C-------------------&W

If you have changed the thing you are working on in any way, taking the 
"Q" option from the top-most menu will save the object, if you respond
with a "Y" at the save object prompt.

&WThe &Gzedit &Wcommand is used to create new &Gzones&W, change the 
characteristics of existing &Gzones&W, and create and edit individual 
&Gzone &Wcommands. 
The first variant of the &Gzedit &Wcommand is used to change values for an
existing &Gzone &Wand add or modify the &Gzone &Wcommands that relate to a
particular room. If no room number is given, &Gzedit &Wwill work with the 
room the player is currently in, or if a room number is specified, it will work with the &Gzone &Wthat contains that room.  The &Gzedit &Wmenu is in 
two parts, the upper part being used to set the overall value for the total
&Gzone &W(&Gzone &Wname, reset mode, and so on), while the lower part lists
the &Gzone &Wcommands that relate to the particular room.
The second variant is used to create a brand new &Gzone&W, specifying the 
&Gzone &Wnumber and the range of room vnums that the &Gzone &Wcontains. 
This will bring up the standard &Gzone &Wedit menu.
The third (and final) variant will save the complete &Gzone &Wto the disk

&G BS BACKSTAB BACK-STAB 'BACK STAB'

Syntax  : backstab OR bs <target>
Cooldown: 30 seconds

Backstab is a stealthy, powerful way for thieves and warriors to initate
combat. Due to this skill's secrecy, not much is known to those outside
the circles of combatants. It is up to you to discover the secrets of
this ability.

NOTE: It is known that ONLY warriors and thieves are able to backstab,
and that thieves have a much more skilled ability than warriors.

    &BLevels  &CMultiplier
    &W------  ----------
     &B1-7        &C2
     &B8-13       &C3

#0
&G BASH

Syntax  : bash <target>
Cooldown: 7 seconds

be used after a warrior reclasses to another class.

NOTE: You must be wielding a weapon in order to bash an enemy.

Note that hitting a person who is resting/sitting will inflict 1.5 * damage.

ATTACH

Builder's working on their trial vnum do not need to learn this command, yet.

Usage: attach mob {trigger vnum/name} {mob name} [location]
       attach obj {trigger vnum/name} {obj name} [location]
       attach room {trigger vnum/name} {room vnum} [location]

   Attach lets you attach a script to one instance of a mob/obj/room, for
testing or other purposes. The command only attaches the script once,
and will not last over a reboot (or crash).

The 'location' is what number in the triggerlist the trigger will assume.
It is important to first attach a trigger to test before you manually add it
through oedit/medit/redit. 

Examples:
attach room 14500 14520 - Attaches room trigger 14500 to room 14520.
attach mob 1332 santa   - Attaches mob trigger 1332 to mob 1308 (santa).

BAN UNBAN

Usage: ban [<all | new | select> <site>]
       unban <site>

These commands prevent anyone from a site with a hostname containing the
site substring from logging in to the game.  You may ban a site to ALL, NEW
or SELECT players.  Banning a site to NEW players prevents any new players
from registering.  Banning a site to ALL players disallows ANY connections
from that site.  Banning a site SELECTively allows only players with site-ok
flags to log in from that site.  Ban with no argument returns a list of
currently banned sites.

Unban removes the ban.

Examples:

  > ban all whitehouse.gov
  > unban ai.mit.edu

CHARGE

Syntax  : charge (room attack)
Cooldown: 15 seconds

Using this skill, a warrior attempts to knock down every enemy in
a specific area. If successful, the affects to an enemy are similar
to the BASH effect, in that they will be unable to use their
abilities. This skill can be used by any class once learned as a
warrior.

NOTE: This ability only works against NPC's.

#0
COMMENT * 

* This is an example of a comment in trigedit. Because of the *'s the lines 
* are not parsed, so the script still works even if it has a lot of 
* explanations built in. All triggers should be heavily commented.

* The below line sends the text 'Trigger firing' to the room.
%echo% Trigger firing

   Comments are useful in scripts to document what is happening, for future 
reference, and for others to see what the script does.

CONTEXT

Usage: context number
* This little script will make sure one %has_said_hello% exist for each player.
context %actor.id%
set has_said_hello 1
global has_said_hello
* now only scripts running with context = %actor.id% can access this particular 
* variable. however - it's a better idea to use vars set on players: help remote.

   Changes the "context" of a script to this value. When first run, a script's 
context is 0. When a variable is made global, it is given the current context. 
When a variable is accessed, if it must be searched for globally, a "found" 
variable must either have context 0 or the current context. The net result of 
this is you may have many global variables in a single script, with the same 
name, differing only by context. Players may have variables; this mostly 
removes the need for variable context. Previously, a player's ID could be used 
as variable context to allow a script to service multiple players at once.

COUNTERATTACK COUNTER-ATTACK 'COUNTER ATTACK'

Refining parry to an art, Knights are able to use the chance to strike
back at an enemy. If successful, a Knight will land a normal melee attack
in response to an enemy's. This ability is automatic once learned. Due to
the skill required, only Knights may use this ability.

NOTE: You must have parry trained fully in order to use counter attack.

DC

Usage: dc <descriptor number>

DC (DisConnect) is used to disconnect a socket.  If used on a playing socket,
the player will lose his/her link, but, unlike PURGE, will not extract the
player or dump the player's inventory on the ground.

DC is also useful for disconnecting people who have accidentally left
themselves at the main menu, or connections sitting in the "Get name" state.

DETACH

Builder's working on their trial vnum do not need to learn this command, yet.   

Usage: detach [mob | obj] {target name} {trigger name/vnum | 'all'}
       detach room {target vnum | '.'} {trigger name/vnum | 'all'}

   Detach removes a script to one instance of a mob/obj/room, for testing or 
other purposes. The command only removes the trigger temporarily, until the
room/obj/mob is reloaded via reboot, zreset, load.

Use the optional arguments 'mob' and 'obj' to differentiate if more entities
with the same alias are in the room.

Examples:
detach room 14500 14520 - remove trigger 14500 from room 14520.
detach room all         - removes all triggers from a room.
detach santa 1332       - detach trigger 1332 from mob 1308 (santa).
detach mob santa all    - detach all triggers from Santa.
detach santa all        - Same as above.
detach sword 1300       - detach trigger 1300 from sword.
detach obj sword 1300   - You guessed it - same as above.
detach sword all        - detach all triggers from the sword.

* in %result%:
eval result %self.hitp% * 100 / %self.maxhitp% 
say My hitpoint percentage is %result%
* this result will not change after the evaluation even if %self.hitp% changes.

   The eval command is used to set (or create) the specified variable equal to 
the result of the immediate evaluation of the provided expression. There also 
exists a "set" command, with the same syntax. Set differs in that the expression
is not evaluated until the variable is accessed.

EXPRESSIONS TRIGEDIT-EXPRESSIONS INCREMENTS MATHEMATICAL /= || \

A false expression is any expression that evaluates to 0, or an empty string.
A true expression is any expression that evaluates to anything other than a
false expression. The following list are the recognized operators. The higher
the operator is on the list, the higher the precedence. The expression is
evaluated from left to right. Parenthesis can be used to group. 

|Operator|         Name          | Examples  0=False 1=True  |
--------------------------------------------------------------
|   ||   | logical or            | 0 || ( ) = 0; 5 || 0 = 1  |

Example: &RTSTAT 63&n
#0
EXTRACT

Usage: extract to-variable word-number from-text
* could be used to do strange things to what people say:
extract testvar1 1 %speech%
extract testvar2 2 %speech%
extract testvar3 3 %speech%
extract testvar4 4 %speech%
say do you mean %testvar4% %testvar3% %testvar2% %testvar1% ?

   Place a specific word from the 'from-text' into a new or existing variable 
'to-variable'. Do not enclose the name of the to-variable in %'s.
#0
FORCE

Usage: force <victim | all> <command> <arguments>

FORCE forces a character, either monster or player, to perform a certain
action.  FORCE ALL forces everyone in the game; FORCE ROOM forces everyone in
your room.

Example:

  > force fido drop meat
  > force all save
  > force room look fido

If you are invisible to the one being forced, the force will be performed
silently.
#0
FREEZE THAW

Usage: freeze <victim>
       thaw <victim>

FREEZE, originally invented here at CircleMUD (we think), is used to prevent
a player from playing.  If frozen, the game will ignore all commands entered
by the player, including QUIT, until the player is unfrozen with THAW.

Obviously, this command should only be used in extreme disciplinary
circumstances.

See also: SET -> FROZEN
#0
FURNITURE COUCH CHAIR

   There is no object type for furniture since this is stock CircleMUD. But it
can be done through trigedit. Just set the object type to OTHER and attach a
trigger similar to the example below. Just change the word chair to the name
you desire.

Example: &RTSTAT 1399&n
#0
GLOBALS GLOBAL-VARIABLES GLOBAL-VARS GVARS

Usage: global variablename
* To make a variable 'reachable' from other scripts it has to be made 'global'. 
* In this case I make a local known var %has_bribed_guard% and make it global. 
* It's a good idea to use this in conjunction with context.
global has_bribed_guard

   Used to change a variable from local to global. If a global variable is 
modified, this command must be used to update the global contents as well.

Example: &RTSTAT 45&n

See Also: VARIABLES, CONTEXT
#0
GOTO TRANS WIZTELEPORT

Usage: goto <location>
       trans <victim>
       teleport <victim> <location>

These commands are used to transports yourself and others to different rooms.
GOTO allows you to go to other rooms; TRANS transports a person from wherever
they are to the room YOU are in; TELEPORT transports your victim to some other
location.

For both GOTO and TELEPORT, the location specifier can be either a virtual
room number, or the name of a character or object.

Examples:

  > goto 3001
  > goto rasmussen
  > trans fido
  > teleport fido 3001
  > teleport fido 2.fido

See also: POOFIN, POOFOUT, SET -> ROOM, WIZAT
#0
HALT

Usage: halt

   Halt terminates the trigger execution.    

* This script attacks players of level 20 and above. The reason for the use of 
* halt and return 0 is to make sure other scripts are checked too.
if %actor.level% < 20
  return 0
  halt
end
  %echo% %self.name% yells a Battlecry and throws himself at you.
  mkill %actor%

   Terminates the trigger execution.
#0
HANDBOOK

Usage: handbook

Guidelines for having an Immortal character -- you should read it.
#0
HCONTROL

Usage: hcontrol build <house vnum> <exit dir> <player name>
       hcontrol destroy <house vnum>
       hcontrol pay <house vnum>
       hcontrol show

House control, controls the addition, removal, and payments of houses.
Hcontrol show will show all the houses currently defined in the game
along with their last 'rent' payment date.

See also: HOUSE, HOUSES
#0
HEROISM

Syntax   : cast heroism <self>
Cooldown : 5 minutes
Duration : 90 seconds
Mana Cost: 50 mana

When this ability is cast, a Knight charges bravely into a
fight, taking the brunt of attacks from any enemy in the area.
Only Knights may use this ability.

NOTE: When used, you will immediately have the attention of
every enemy in the area, consider this before casting heroism.
#0
HOLYLIGHT

Usage: holylight

A toggle which allows you to see:
   Invisible people and objects, even if you don't have 'detect invisibility'
   Hidden people, even if you don't have 'sense life'
   Dark rooms, even if you don't have a light

It is expected most immortals will keep HOLYLIGHT on most of the time;
it exists so that you have the ability to see what mortals see for
debugging purposes.
#0
IF ELSEIF END

Usage: if (expression)
...
 elseif (expression)
...
 else
...
 end
   if (if %actor.vnum% == -1) 
     %echo% You are a player
   else 
     %echo% You are a mob.
   end

   An 'if' must occur before the other three. If expression evaluates to true 
(&RHELP EXPRESSIONS&n), the statements between the if statement and the next 
elseif, else, or end are executed. If it stopped at an elseif or else, it scans 
for the next end, and continues execution at that point. If the expression 
evaluated to false, it searches for the next elseif, else, or end. If it finds 
an elseif, it checks that expression. If it is true, it executes the statements 
between the elseif and the next elseif, else, or end, and then finds the end of
the block. If it is false, it continues searching in the same pattern, until a 
true elseif is found, an else is found, or an end is found. There may be 0 or 
1 else statements and 0 or many elseif statements in the block.

For anyone having trouble with the format of if/elseif/else/end blocks
&RTSTAT 22&n. Relsqui made this excellent example.

***EVERY IF NEEDS AN END: 2 IF'S NEEDS 2 ENDS....***

MAKEUID VAREXISTS %VAREXISTS% %EXISTS% EXISTS

Usage: makeuid variable id
* We have one mob giving a quest. This mob sets the targets id as a global on 
* the player via the 'remote' command, like this:
eval quest_object %obj.id%
remote quest_object %actor.id%
* We then have another mob receiving the quest object, with the following script.
if !(%actor.varexists(quest_object)%)
  return 0
  halt
end
* now we know the player has a quest_object variable
makeuid obj %actor.quest_object%
say Have you brought me %obj.shortdesc%, %actor.name% ?
say You must bring it to me to complete your quest, you know.

   Creates a new variable with the name given, whose contents shall be suitable

NESTED-IFS

   A nested if is an if statement contained within another if or if...else 
statement. Nested if's allow the creation of a decision tree or flow chart
of events with multiple conclusions. 
   Always use /f to format and indent your trigger. This will warn you if you
do not have the correct number of ifs to ends. &RWARNING:&n multiple unmatched
if/ends will crash us. Make sure everything lines up with /f before you test.
 
Example: &RTSTAT 1490, 41000&n
#0
NOHASSLE

Usage: nohassle

Toggles a flag to prevent aggressive monsters from attacking.
#0
NOP

   Almost a no-operation. Certain variable/subfield combinations for characters 
change some attribute about the character. nop allows those changes to be used 
legally on lines that do not need to process the result.

* this will award the actor with 10 gold
nop %actor.gold(10)%
* this awards 10 experience
nop %actor.exp(10)%

Here is a workaround to use a variable:
  *nop workaround
  eval making %%self.gold(%coins%)%%
  nop %making%

#0
NOTITLE

Usage: notitle <vicitim>

Prevent players from being able to set their own titles; i.e., if the
player consistently has an offensive title.  The definition of offensive
is left as an exercise for the reader.

NUMERIC-ARGUMENTS NUMARG NARG TRIGEDIT-NUMERIC-ARGUMENTS TRIGEDIT-ARGUMENTS 

4) Numeric Arg : &y100&n
5) Arguments   : 

Dependant on the trigger type, these values will mean different things. For 
instance, if you've decided to use a hitpcnt trigger, the numeric Arg is the 
percent a mobs hit points have to fall to, before the trigger is activated, 
and the command list is executed.

#0
PARRY

This skill allows a warrior to use his weapon to deflect oncoming
melee attacks during combat. You must be wielding a weapon for this
skill to be effective. Parry is automatically used during combat once
trained. This skill can be used by any class once learned as a warrior.
#0
POOFIN POOFOUT

Usage: poofin <message>
       poofout <message>

Sets the message seen by players when you use GOTO to move to a different
room.  POOFIN with no argument resets your poofin to the default "appears with
an ear-splitting bang"; POOFOUT with no argument defaults to "disappears in
a puff of smoke."

See also: GOTO
#0
PURGE

Usage: purge [name]

Purge destroys things.  If used with no arguments, it will clear a room of all
mobiles and objects, but will not harm players.  If the argument is an object,
that object (and all of its contents, if any) will be destroyed.  If the
argument is a mobile, the mobile will be destroyed, leaving its inventory and
equipment lying on the ground.

If the argument is the name of a player, the player's inventory and equipment
will drop on the ground and the player will lose his/her connection.  For this
reason, PURGE should only be used on players in disciplinary situations.

Examples:

  > purge
  > purge Pom
  > purge sword
  > purge dragon

#0
RANDOM-TIMING TIMING

Since random triggers fire every 13 seconds you can set how often the trigger
fires by modifying numeric arg to the following values:

1%   = 22 minutes
2%   = 11 minutes
5%   =  4 minutes
10%  =  2 minutes
20%  =  1 minute
50%  = 26 seconds
100% = 13 seconds

RDELETE

Usage: rdelete variable id
* This is used to remove a variable
say Thank you, %actor.name% - your quest is completed.
rdelete quest_object %actor.id%

   Delete a remote variable from the script referred to by the id of its owner.

See Also: VDELETE, REMOTE
#0
RELOAD

Usage: reload < '*' | all | file >

Reload is used to reload text files such as the MOTD from disk into memory.
reload * reloads all the text files below.

Valid files are:

  background (/mud_dir/lib/text/background)
  credits    (/mud_dir/lib/text/credits)
  greetings  (/mud_dir/lib/text/greetings)
  handbook   (/mud_dir/lib/text/handbook)
  help       (/mud_dir/lib/text/help)
  immlist    (/mud_dir/lib/text/immlist)
  imotd      (/mud_dir/lib/text/imotd)
  news       (/mud_dir/lib/text/news)
  motd       (/mud_dir/lib/text/motd)
  info       (/mud_dir/lib/text/info)
  policy     (/mud_dir/lib/text/policies)
  wizlist    (/mud_dir/lib/text/wizlist)
  xhelp      (/mud_dir/lib/text/help/*)
#0
REMOTE

Usage: remote <variable> <id>

Remoting a variable saves that variable to the player file for future access. 
This is used heavily for quests to limit a player to only performing it once.
Here is a quick example from zone 14. The variable must first be set and then
saved to the players file via remote, like:
  * setting the variable to 1 means completed.
  set solved_example_quest_zone_14 1
  remote solved_example_quest_zone_14 %actor.id%
Then in future triggers it is checked if that variable already exists in the
player file. In this example, if it does the player is not allowed to continue.
<variable> should always be a unique name. I suggest always including zone #.
<id> can be any value or text you wish to use later.

   Create a global variable belonging to a character or player whose id is 
specified. The variable must first exist in the script that is running.

For more examples go through the trigedit hallway.
Examples: &RTSTAT 1409-1411, 23612-23614&n

Syntax   : cast sense <self>
Cooldown : 5 seconds
Duration : 15 minutes
Mana Cost: 20 mana

Due to their experience in the wild, Rangers have the
unique ability to sense hidden trails throughout the
world. When cast, this ability allows Rangers to 'see'
through hidden and illusionary exits. Only Rangers may
use this ability.

Example:

#0
SET

Usage: set [ file | player ] <character> <field> <value>

SET is an extremely powerful command, capable of setting dozens of aspects of
characters, both players and mobiles.

SET PLAYER forces set to look for a player and not a mobile; useful for
players with names such as 'guard'.

SET FILE lets you change players who are not logged on.  If you use SET FILE
on a player who IS logged on, your change will be lost.  If you wish to set
a player who is in the game but is linkless, use set twice -- once with the
FILE argument, and once without -- to make sure that the change takes.

For toggled fields (BINARY), the value must be ON, OFF, YES, or NO.

The following are valid fields:

Field          Level Required   Who     Value Type   Decription

SHUTDOWN

Usage: shutdown [reboot | die | pause]

SHUTDOWN shuts the MUD down.  The SHUTDOWN command works in conjunction with
CircleMUD's 'autorun' script.  If you are not using autorun, the arguments are
meaningless.  If you are using autorun, the following arguments are available:

REBOOT     Pause only 5 seconds instead of the normal 40 before trying to
           restart the MUD.

DIE        Kill the autorun script; the MUD will not reboot until autorun is
           explicitly run again.

PAUSE      Create a file called 'paused' in Circle's root directory; do not
           try to restart the MUD until 'paused' is removed.

#0
SNOOP

Usage: snoop [player]

Snoop allows you to listen in on another player's session; everything the
player sees or types will be displayed on your terminal preceded by a '%'.

Obviously, there are many ethical considerations to the use of this command; 
snoop should be used minimally, and only for disciplinary purposes.

Type snoop <your name> or just snoop to stop snooping.
#0
SNOWBALL

Snowball is just a social -- it prints a funny message, and nothing more.
#0
STAT

Usage: stat [player | object | mobile | file] <name>

Gives information about players, monsters, and objects in the game.  The type
argument is optional.

STAT PLAYER will search only for players; useful for statting people with
names such as Red or Cityguard.

STAT OBJECT will search only for objects.

STAT MOBILE will search only for monsters.

STAT FILE is used to stat players who are not logged in; the information
displayed comes from the playerfile.

Examples:

  > stat fido
  > stat player red
  > stat mobile red
  > stat file niandra
  > stat object thunderbolt

See also: VSTAT
#0
STRING

Usage: string <type> <name> <field> [<string> | <keyword>]

For changing the text-strings associated with objects and characters.  The
format is:

Type is either 'obj' or 'char'.

Field is one of the following(the names may be abbreviated):

Name                  (the call-name of an obj/char - kill giant)
Short                 (for inventory lists (obj's) and actions (char's))
Long                  (for when obj/character is seen in room)
Title                 (for players)
Description           (For look at.  For obj's, must be followed by a keyword)
Delete-description    (only for obj's. Must be followed by keyword)

Where a string is expected as the last argument, a newline will make you enter
a string mode, and the game will prompt you for new lines to the string until
you exceed the maximum length for the string or you end a line with a '@'.

Mobiles and objects currently cannot be strung.
#0
SUMMONMOUNT SUMMON-MOUNT 'SUMMON MOUNT'

Syntax   : cast summon mount
Cooldown : 15 minutes
Duration : Immediate
Mana Cost: 50 mana

Due to their close relationship with the wilderness, Rangers
can call upon the wild to assist them in their time of need.
When cast, this spell will summon a noble stallion to aid a
Ranger as a mount. Only Rangers may use this ability and the
stallion will only suffer a Ranger to ride him.
#0
SWITCH

Usage: switch <monster>

SWITCH is used to take over the body of mobiles; useful for interactive
adventures.  If the monster in which you are switched is killed you will be
returned to your own body.

SYSLOG

Usage: syslog [off | brief | normal | complete]

The SYSLOG command controls how detailed of an on-line system log you see.
Messages surrounded by '[' and ']' are syslog messages and are in green
if you have color on.

The messages you receive are level dependent.

Examples:

  > syslog complete
  > syslog off

TEXT-EDITOR TEXTEDITOR /d /i /h /s /a /c /ra /l /fi WORDWRAP WORD-WRAP FORMATTING /e#
   The text editor is what you use to write room/mob/obj/extra descriptions,
mudmails, and even boards. It allows you more commands than the typical entry.
To learn the commands while using the text editor, type /h. It will tell you
what all the / commands do. Always use /fi to format, indent, and word wrap.
It looks much better to see writing that is formatted than one that runs all
over the place wrapping around etc. Just simply type /fi on a new line and hit
enter. Before you save type /l to list the buffer and see for yourself how it
looks. Fix as needed.
   When entering the text editor for the first time make sure to use /c to clear
the current contents. Indent and format all descriptions by typing /fi (format
with indent) in the text editor.  This includes all forms of OLC, mudmails,
boards, and anywhere else you use the text editor. This will indent the line
by 3 spaces and wrap your text at less than 80 characters so telnet users can
read it.
 
Editor command formats: /<letter>
 
&n/a         -  aborts editor
&n/c         -  clears buffer
&n/d#        -  deletes a line #
&n/e# <text> -  changes the line at # with <text>
&n/f         -  formats text. 
&n/fi        -  indented formatting of text (highly recommended for all desc's)
&n/h         -  list text editor commands
&n/i# <text> -  inserts <text> before line #
&n/l         -  lists buffer
&n/n         -  lists buffer with line numbers
&n/r 'a' 'b' -  replace 1st occurance of text <a> in buffer with text
&n/ra 'a' 'b'-  replace all occurances of text <a> within buffer with text
        usage: /ra 'pattern' 'replacement'
&n/s         -  saves text

NOTE: /f and /fi in trigedit will autoindent your trigger.
Commands such as /r, /n, /e#, /i#, /d# are invaluable and will make your job
much easier. For example lets say you mistype "the" with "teh" in a 10 line
description. Instead of /c (clearing) the text you can /r 'teh' 'the' or if it
was on line 5 you can type /e5 <line with teh spelled correctly> or /d5. Learn
all these options.
#0
TLIST TRIGLIST TRIG-LIST TRIGEDIT-LIST 

Usage: tlist <range of vnums or zone number>

Tlist gives you a list of the triggers numbered within the parameters.
Be warned that all the triggers on TBA may not work since anyone could
have made them. Ask around for the best examples. Zone 13, 40, 41 is a 
good start.

   tlist 13          - lists all triggers defined in zone 13
   tlist 4000 4099   - lists all existing triggers from vnum 4000 to 4099

TRIG-ATTACH

Usage: attach vnum id
* This small trigger will attach a trigger to the carrier this can for instance 
* be used if you want the mob to change attitude by adding another trigger 
* (ie - mob was mad - mob got apple - mob gets a 'nicer' trigger attached
attach 3001 %self.id% 

   This command allows a script to attach a trigger (referenced by vnum) to 
anything capable of receiving triggers, by id number. (%self.id%, %object.id%, 
and %actor.id% are examples of id numbers, for use with this command.)

* if we - as described in the attach example, want our mob/obj/room to behave
* differently, it's not always enough to just add another trigger with attach.
* it might be necessary to remove some old ones :
detach 3000 %self.id%
or
detach all %self.id%

   The opposite of attach, this removes triggers from the specified target.

Example: &RTSTAT 45&n

See Also: ATTACH, DETACH, TRIG-ATTACH
#0
TRIG-RETURN
 
Usage: return 0
 
   Return sets the return value of the trigger. Normally, a script will return
1, unless return 0 is specified. Unlike most computer languages, the return  
command does not end the trigger's execution. The value is returned after all 
the commands have been executed, or a wait or halt command is called. 

Example: &RTSTAT 1364&n

See Also: HALT, WAIT
#0
TRIG-SET

Usage: set <variable> <value>

Set sets variable to value, without evaluating it. 
 Example: set foobar 15 - 5
 sets the variable foobar to the string "15 - 5"

* this example sets the value of result to '%self.hitp% * 100 / %self.maxhitp%'
set result %self.hitp% * 100 / %self.maxhitp% 
* The %result% var now works as a 'function' every time it's accessed.
say My hitpoint percentage is %result%
%damage% %self% 30
say My hitpoint percentage is %result%

   The set command is used to set (or create) the specified variable equal to 
the provided expression, which will be evaluated when the variable is accessed. 
There also exists an "eval" command, with the same syntax. Eval differs in that 
the expression is evaluated immediately.

See Also: EVAL
#0
TRIG-SWITCH TRIGEDIT-SWITCH CASE DEFAULT BREAK

Usage: switch expression
    
switch %random.4%
  case 1
    emote sings a merry song about someone named Fulbert and Beatrice.
  break
  case 2
    emote booms out loudly, 'Heigh Ho! Heigh Ho! It's home from work we go!'
  break
  case 3
    emote tries to sing falsetto, but his voice doesn't agree.
  break
  default
    sing
  break
done

   Switch evaluates an expression and looks for a match amongst the case 
statements that follow. If none of the following case statements are a match, 
and a default statement exists, the default statement is considered a match. 
If a match is found, the commands that follow it, up until a break or done 
command, are executed. 
Break is used to terminate commands in a switch. 
Case is used to begin a new conditional group in a switch block.
Default is similiar to case but matches any condition not met. 
Done is used to terminate a while or switch block.

TRIGEDIT-ADVANCED

&RWARNING: long and verbose (wordy)&n

To add life to the worlds circlemud uses something called scripts (or triggers). 
There are three major types of game objects which can use scripts. These are 
mobiles (mobs), objects, and rooms (world objects). Examples of scripts in the 
game are: 

Cityguards screaming 'PROTECT THE INNOCENT! BANZAI! CHARGE!', (a mob script).
A portal that teleports players when they enter it (an object script).
A room that creates a new exit when a player pulls a lever (a room script).

Each game item (room, mobile, or object) can have a script. A script is composed
of one or more triggers, which work in collaboration to define complex actions 
of the game object. A trigger is a definition of an event that the script watches 
for, and list of commands to execute when that event occurs. 

There are several different types of triggers. Each trigger type determines
when the trigger will be checked. For example, a mob speech trigger is checked
every time a character who is in the same room as the mob with the trigger uses
the 'say' command. A room enter trigger is checked every time a character
enters the room. There are two parts of the trigger used to determine if the
trigger's commands are executed when it is checked, the argument and numerical
argument (NArg). Some triggers use both; some may use only one of the two; and
some may use neither. The interpretation of these two fields is dependant on
the type, and is described in more detail on the webpage and in the help files.

When an event in the game occurs, each script in the room where the event 
occurred is checked to see if there are any triggers which are supposed to
react to that event. A trigger currently running (such as from a 'wait'
command) is skipped. Only one trigger of each script will be run by a single
event. For example, if there are two triggers on a script, and both are the
same type with the same arguments, the second trigger will only be run if the
first one is already running. 

Triggers can be of more than one type. For example, to simulate a cursed item,
a trigger on the object could be of types drop, give, and remove. A more common
combined trigger would have both random and global types, so the random trigger
would be checked even when the zone was empty. Combined triggers must have the
same argument and numerical argument. 

The other component of a trigger is the command list. This is a series of
commands that are executed when the trigger is run. Commands are chosen from
two groups of commands, script specific commands and game commands. Script
specific commands are those commands that only the script interpreter can
recognize. These include flow control commands (such as if, elseif, else, end,
halt, wait, and return), and commands to manipulate variables (such as set,
eval, unset, and global). Game commands are those commands that a player could
issue from their command line as well as special commands added for mobiles,
objects, and rooms.

TRIGEDIT-ADVANCED-TUTORIAL

This section is a step by step tutorial to explain the writing of scripts 
(triggers). It goes through the script creation process developing a practical
script. 

Decide what you want the script to do. 
   Consider how your mob, item, or room should behave. Doing this before
worrying what can be done prevents you from limiting yourself to what you have
seen other scripts do, and allows you to produce a more interesting script. 
  
For example, I want to create a gate guard for a small walled town. The ruler
of the town has decided that each group of people will be charged ten coins to
enter his domain. The gate guard must notify travelers of the cost to enter,
collect the money, allow people who have payed to enter the city, and close the
gate after them. This will be a mob script. 
  
Decide what trigger types you need.
   Look through the section on triggers to see the currently available trigger
types. New trigger types can be added by one of the implementors if needed. All
types are listed in the help files &RHELP TRIGEDIT-TYPE&n.
  
Our gate guard needs to react to five different events: 

1. A character entering the room from the south, the road leading away from the
   town, needs to be informed of the price for entrance. This will be a greet
   trigger. 
2. When the guard is given ten or more coins, the guard must open the gate. This
   is done by a bribe trigger. 
3. If the guard is given less than ten coins, the guard needs to inform the
   character that it is insufficient. This is also a bribe trigger. 
4. When someone passes through the gate into the city, the guard must close the
   gate behind them. This is done with an act trigger. 
5. When the gate is opened from the other side, the guard must eventually close
   it. This will be another act trigger. 

Determine the argument and the numerical argument of the triggers. Read the 
specifications on trigger types, and decide what the values for argument and 
Numeric Arg must be for the trigger to react appropriately to the events.
  
&RHELP TRIGEDIT-MOB-GREET&n
Argument    : not used 
Numeric Arg : the percent chance that the trigger is run when checked. Since I 
              want it run every time someone enters the room, it should be 100. 

&RHELP TRIGEDIT-MOB-BRIBE&n
Argument    : not used
Numeric Arg . minimum number of gold pieces required to activate this trigger.
              The guard should only open the gate when given 10 coins, so it
              should be 10. 

For the second bribe trigger, the guard must respond whenever someone gives 
him 1 or more coins, so Numeric Arg should be 1. 

&RHELP TRIGEDIT-MOB-ACT&n
Argument    : the text the mob should react to. Since I want the guard to 
              react to a character going north, argument should be "leaves 
              north." 
Numeric Arg : Since argument is a phrase, NArg should be 0. 

The second act trigger should trigger on text "The gate is opened from the other
side", so it is triggered whenever someone opens the gate from inside the town.
Again, Numeric Arg should be 0 for a phrase. 
  
Write the list of commands for the trigger.
This is the most complex and time consuming part of a trigger to write. The
valid commands are explained in the help files and on the webpage. Variables 
and expressions are also used in the commands list.

For the greet trigger, I want the guard to inform anyone entering from the
south how to get into the city. First, I must check if the character is
entering from the south. If they are entering from that direction, the guard
should tell the character the cost of entry. The command list for this trigger
will be as follows: 
  
if (%direction% == south) 
 wait 1 sec
 emote snaps to attention as you approach. 
 wait 1 sec
 say Admittance to the city is 10 coins. 
end 
 
Checking the specifications of the greet trigger, we see that the variable
"direction" is set to the direction that the character entered. The percent
sign surrounding direction means it is a variable. The two equal signs together
compare the value of the variable to the word "south". If these are equal, the
statements between this line and the line "end" will be executed. The "wait 1 sec"
pauses briefly while the character finishes his move. (The greet trigger is
actually checked before the character enters the room, so if we did not have
this line, he or she would never see the guard snap to attention.) After
another brief pause, the guard announces the cost to enter the town. The
indentations are not needed, but make it easier to read. 

The guard must open the gate if ten or more coins were given to him. The
command list looks like this: 
  
wait 1 sec
unlock gate 
open gate 
wait 10 sec 
close gate 
lock gate 
  
After a brief wait (so everything doesn't happen at once), the guard unlocks
the gate and opens it. The guard will close the gate after 10 seconds, even if
no one passes through it. 

The guard must inform the character that his payment was not enough, and
return the money. The commands list will be: 
  
wait 1 sec
say This is not enough! 
give %amount% coins %actor.name% 
  
For the line "give %amount% coins %actor.name%", the variables amount and actor,
both set when the bribe trigger is called, are substituted into the line before
the guard performs the command. The gate guard returns the number of coins he
was given. 

For the first act trigger, I want the guard to close and lock the gate after
someone passes through the gate. The guard should wait briefly so he isn't
shutting the gate on the character's back, and close and lock the gate. The
command list will be: 

wait 1 sec
close gate 
lock gate 
  
For the last act trigger we want the guard to close and lock the gate when it 
is opened from the other side. The commands will look like: 
  
wait 5 sec 
close gate 
lock gate 
  
The "wait 5 sec" gives time for someone on the other side to get through the gate. 
Decide the order of the triggers. The triggers are checked from first to last.
If there are two triggers of the same type, the first one run will be the only
one run. 

There are two sets of triggers which are the same type, the bribe triggers and
the act triggers. If the bribe trigger with the Numeric Arg of 1 is first, the 
other trigger would never be run, since ten or more coins is still one or more. 
In order for my triggers to work right, the trigger with Numeric Arg of 10 must 
be before the trigger with the NArg of 1 in the list. The other possible 
conflict is with the act triggers. Since both have arguments that will not 
occur together, the order does not matter. 

Create the trigger file.
Simply use trigedit to create your triggers and they will be saved for you
when you exit the editor. 

Put the triggers into the game.
In the OasisOLC medit / redit / oedit menus, use menu option S to enter the
script editor. Then select the triggers that will be part of your script. Note,
that order is important! If there are two possible triggers that could both be
executed at the same time, only the first one found in the list will be
activated. In this example, it means place the bribe trigger for 10 or more
coins BEFORE the bribe trigger for 1 coin. 

Test the script.
You should see how the script actually works in the game, and watch other
people interact with it. Often you will see ways you can improve it.

The following 7 steps should give you a general idea about what to do, and how to go 
about making small quests in the dg scripting language. This example is concentrated 
on quests involving mobs. 

The process can be broken down to the following:  
   1. Decide what you want the script to do.
   2. Make corresponding objects and mobs.
   3. Split up the quest.
   4. Find corresponding trigger types.
   5. write the scripts for the triggers.
   6. Attach the scripts - permanently
   7. Done ? 
   
1. Decide what you want the script to do.  
   In this example, we want to make a small mini quest in an area. The quest 
will work like this: When you enter the room, where the first mob is, it will 
start to tell a tale. In this tale, you are instructed to perform a task, in 
this case, kill an evil ogre, that lives in a nearby forest. As proof of the 
kill, you must bring back the ogre's apprehension to the questgiving mob. 

2. Make corresponding objects and mobs.  
   Ingredients for this quest:
      1 Questgiver mob - I've chosen 'the questmaster' - vnum 1310
      1 Target mob - In this case 'an apprehensive Ogre' - vnum 1311
      1 Quest object - 'some apprehension' - trash object, vnum 1300 

3. Split up the quest.  
   Next thing to do is look at the different steps involved with the quest. In 
this example, we have three steps: 
   Player entering room -> tell story 
   Player finds ogre -> load object (Do not just want the mob to carry it) 
   Player gives questmaster apprehension -> reward player 

4. Find corresponding trigger types.  
   Having split the quest up also means we reasonably easy can decide what 
kinds of triggers we need - in this case: 
   mob GREET trigger (attached to questmaster) 
   mob DEATH trigger (attached to ogre) 
   mob RECEIVE trigger (attached to questmaster) 
 
5. write the scripts for the triggers.  
    Up to this point, neither trigedit or the script editors have been used. 
All the info needed is in the help files and on the webpages. Notice most of
the work required is PLANNING! You must know exactly what you want to do before
you do it. Now is the time to fire up trigedit and start editing the triggers. 
Let's give the first one vnum 0, and edit it to look like the script below: 


> trigedit 0
Trigger Editor [0]

1) Name         : &yMob Tutorial Example 1310 - Quest Offer&n
2) Intended for : &yMobiles&n
3) Trigger types: &yGreet &n
4) Numeric Arg : &y100&n
5) Arguments    : 
6) Commands:
&c* we don't want him to tell this to mobs. vnum -1 is reserved for players.
if %actor.vnum% == -1
  * only greet players coming from the south.
  if %direction% == south
    *wait 1 second, always give the player time before you start sending text.
    wait 1 sec
    say Can you help me, %actor.name%?
    wait 1 sec
    say An apprehensive ogre has something of mine.
    wait 1 sec
    say If you slay him I'll give you all the coins I can spare.
    wait 1 sec
    say Please, bring me the apprehension he has stolen.
  end
end&n

The script above will be executed every time anyone enters the room. If the 
person entering is a mobile, the if check at the beginning will stop the 
execution. Note, that I've named the trigger as I did above. ALWAYS include
the VNUM of where you plan on attaching the trigger. Also, give it a name so 
it is easy to see what part of the quest this trigger handles. The second 
script is very simple.

> trigedit 1
Trigger Editor [1]

1) Name         : &yMob Tutorial Example 1311 - Kill ogre&n
2) Intended for : &yMobiles&n
3) Trigger types: &yDeath&n
4) Numeric Arg : &y100&n
5) Arguments    : 
6) Commands:
&csay you got the best of me %actor.name%.
* load some apprehension
%load% obj 1300
* reload the mob for the next questor
%load% mob 1311&n

The above script will be executed when the mob is killed - just before the 
death cry. The last script just needs to check if the object handed over is 
the correct one. Let's see it, here with vnum 2: 

> trigedit 2
Trigger Editor [2]

1) Name         : &yMob Tutorial Example 1310 - Give/Quest Completion&n
2) Intended for : &yMobiles&n
3) Trigger types: &yReceive&n
4) Numeric Arg : &y100&n
5) Arguments    : 
6) Commands:
&c* check if this was indeed the right object
if %object.vnum% == 1300
  wait 1 sec
  say Thank you, %actor.name%
  %send% %actor% %self.name% gives you a gold piece.
  %echoaround% %actor% %actor.name% is rewarded for his valor.
  nop %actor.gold(1)%
  wait 5 sec
  %purge% obj 1300
else
  * this wasn't the right object - don't accept it
  say I don't want that - bring me back my apprehension.
  return 0
end&n

The script above is pretty self explanatory, but to clarify a bit: First check 
if the object is the correct vnum, then give the reward, and send messages to 
the player and others in the room. If it wasn't the object, reject it, and use 
the return value of the script to prevent the object being passed over. Lastly, 
and very importantly, 'end' ends the if. 

6. Attach the scripts - permanently  
   Proceed and add the scripts to the two mobiles through medit: 

> medit 1310
[medit menu]
Enter choice ? S
     Script Editor

     Trigger List:
     <none>

 N)  New trigger for this script
 D)  Delete a trigger in this script
 X)  Exit Script Editor

     Enter choice :
Here, add the scripts by typing N, then the script vnum: 
Enter choice : n
Please enter position, vnum   (ex: 1, 200): 0
Enter choice ? n
Please enter position, vnum   (ex: 1, 200): 2
Enter choice ? x

And add the trigger vnum 3 to the ogre in a similar manner. 

7. Done ?  
   The scripts are now attached to the correct mobs, and the players of your 
mud can now take the quest whenever they wish. This is a great time for 
considering improvements to the little quest: 

Balance issues: 
   Should players get a smaller reward if they perform the quest many times ? 
   Should it be limited to 1 quest per player or 1 per reboot ? 
Gameplay issues: 
   Perhaps other mobs in town should tell the player to go see the old man ? 
   Should the ogre always load the object, or only when people know he has it ? 
   Are there other mobs who would like to pay for that object ? 

The above list is just a few examples. All of them could be implemented, but 
it is beyond the scope of this tutorial.

TRIGEDIT-NAMES TRIG-NAMES

1) Name         : &ynew trigger&n

Always use names that explain the trigger. More importantly: always include the
VNUM for the mob/obj/room the trigger is going to be attached to.

   It's important to give your trigger a name you and others can understand. 
Even more important is including the VNUM of what it is attached to. This way
tlist and stat will show the name description and VNUM allowing others to 
quickly comprehend what the trigger does. A good name could be 'guard shout for
help - 101' or 'mage cast poison - 300' even 'cursed object - 130.'

Examples:
   Quest Offer - 1310       --> trigger attached to mob 1310
   Fall Down Stairs - 1300  --> trigger attached to room 1300
   No Dropping Stuff - 1301 --> trigger attached to obj 1301

TRIGEDIT-TRIGGER-TYPES

3) Trigger types: &yGreet&n
This is a bitvector  of which kind of events this trigger is triggered by. This 
is the most important part of the trigger. It's here you decide if you want the 
trigger to react on people dying in the room, dropping objects, saying stuff, 
entering, jumping insanely up and down or whatever else you might think of.

This part is also the most important, in the sense that the rest of the triggers' 
info means different things, depending on what trigger type the trigger has.

TRIGEDIT-VARIABLES VARIABLES TRIG-VARS TRIG-VARIABLES VARS 

Variables appear as a name surrounded by '%'s, such as %actor% 

Before a command is processed, the line is scanned and any variables are
replaced. First the list of local variables are checked to see if the variable
is there. If not, the global variables are checked. A proper global match must
have a zero context or the current context of the script. (When a script starts
running, its context is 0. The script context command may be used to change
context.) If a match is still not found, a list of 'built in' variables (ones
not declared by the script) are checked. If no match is found, the variable is
replaced with an empty string (the variable is removed from the line, and
nothing added in its place).

There are two types of variables, local and global. All local variables are
deleted when a trigger finishes executing, and can only be used by the trigger.
Global variables remain until removed with unset, or the script is removed. 

Global variables also have a context associated with them. By default, the
context is 0. Any global being referenced with a context of zero will be seen.
Through the 'context <value>' command, a script may set its context to any
integer; Globals created are always assigned the current script context. When a
global is referenced, if it's context is not 0 or the current context of the
script, it will not be seen. This technique allows, among other things, arrays
of globals to be created by using a series of contexts as indexes. Also, it
allows globals to be associated with a specific character, room, or object in
the game, by using the id of the target as the context. 

Variable Fields 

A field of a variable can also retrieved, based on their type. To get a field,
a notation of %variable.field% is used. The valid fields are listed in the help
files below. 

&RCHAR-VAR&n - Variables for characters.    &RTSTAT 27&n
&ROBJ-VAR&n  - Variables for objects.       &RTSTAT 28&n
&RROOM-VAR&n - Variables for rooms.         &RTSTAT 29&n
&RTEXT-VAR&n - Variables for text.          &RTSTAT 30&n
