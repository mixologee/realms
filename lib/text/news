&C4&W-&C15&W-&C04&n
&W21: &GNo more stock zones!!&n
&C5&W-&C5&W-&C2004&n
&W21: &Gexp levels were drasticlly raised, this reflects a more old skool med
    feel, pre-mlr era. Also alot of changes to the code, most of it is stable but
    there are a few ruff spots still, so testers keep testing &C:P&n
&C5&W-&C23&W-&C2004&n
&W23: &GLotsa small little changes recently, involving exp(this has been the
    biggest problem in the game), and posse's etc. The new death code is in as
    many of you have probably noticed. It seems to be working as planned but
    we still have some minor issues to fix with it. Help files for world builders
    have been colored, which means the only help files left to be colored are
    the god help files, which most players don't need. Things have been pretty
    quiet here lately, but rest assured progress is being made. Official player
    testing will hopefully begin in June as anticipated. Personally i can't wait,
    i'm very excited.&C:)&n
&C5&W-&C26&W-&C2004&n
&W24: &GThe sex bug has been fixed so that it won't show everyone as yer sex.
    When you level now you will receive some gold.&n

&C6&W-&C10&W-&C2004&n
&W25: &GSome pretty big changes have gone into effect. Where ya quit is
    where you'll come back now, when ya relogin. The login menu is also gone now.
    The City Housing Projects are in! Get your own home for only 100k. Additional
    charges may apply, see a god for details.&n
&C6&W-&C17&W-&C2004&n
&W26: &GWe're pretty sure we finally got that nasty little eq bug. It had 
    something to do with going to the void and then being discon'd. at anyrate 
    it should be fixed now...at least we hope&C:P&n
&W27: &Glotsa thing are being tweaked and finalized in preparation for open 
    player testing. Soon like the mighty death star, this battlestation will be 
    completely operational, and since there's no such thing as x-wings, we should 
    be safe. We pretty sure we have most of the major bugs worked out. I wouldn't 
    say stable yet but if things go well for more than a week, we'll be on solid
    ground.&n
&C6&W-&C24&W-&C2004&n
&W28: &GSorry bout the game being down, a mean storm fucked our shit up.
    Everything is cool now and were right back on track.
&C7&W-&C2&W-&C2004&n
&W29: &GWe've isolated the eq bug to what we beleive is now only a losing
    link issue. If you want to quit, YOU MUST TYPE &RQUIT&G. Zapping, otherwise
    known as losing link is not acceptable. If you zap you run the risk of
    losing all your eq. This is not an idle threat like in other games. We hope
    to have this fixed soon, but at least now its not just happening randomly.&n
&W30: &GOK were, 90% sure it's fixed. After extensive deliberate crashing
    of the whole server we tracked the eq bug down and eliminated it. well 
    not me but bluntmaster, he rules. thankfully all this happened while we 
    weren't officially open for player testing. &C:)&G Now that this is fixed 
    we are officially opening The Game for early player testing. Start messin'
    around and finding those bugs!&n
&C7&W-&C16&W-&C2004&n
&W31: &GPracticing trip now works. sorry bout that.&n

    hotel.&n
&C7&W-&C29&W-&C2004&W
&W33: &GAdded the docks on the western part of the island for travel to the 
    tropical island of the great volcanoes, Mt. Cannibis and Mt. Sativa. What
    awaits the weary travelers in the fierce jungles of the new island?
