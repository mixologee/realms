&CCircleMUD 3.5 &W- &mCircleMUD was developed from DikuMUD(Gamma 0.0) by Jeremy Eleson&n
                &mat Johns Hopkins University's Computer Science Department.  All&n
                &mcode unique to CircleMUD is protected under a copyright by the &n
                &mTrustees of the Johns Hopkins University.  Additional development&n
                &mwas done by Alex Fletcher, George Greer, Daniel Koepke,&n
                &mMichael Curran, Bill Wisner, MAds Haar, Stephan Dahl, Katja Nyboe,&n
                &mTom Madsen, Hans Staerfeldt, Michael Seifert, and Sebastian Hammer.&n
                &mCircleMUD is "freeware" and can be downloaded from various ftp and&n
                &mwww sites by looking it up on the internet.&n

&CtbaMUD 3.56   &W- &mtbaMud is the continuation of a stable working platform of the&n
                &mformer CircleMUD 3.5.  Information about tbaMUD can be found&n
                &mat &Ywww.tbamud.com&n

&CLyonesse      &W- &mLyonesse is a very old and rather well documented hybrid of&n
                &mCircleMud and SMAUG.  We do not know the creators, but we&n
                &mare highly impressed by the documentation and ideas these&n
                &mfolks put together well before most of the mudding world.&n

&CKuvia         &W- &mWe honor every coder that has helped bring forth the current&n 
                &mbuild of &GThe Realms of Kuvia&m.  Currently the codebase, though&n
                &ma very heavily modified hybrid of all of the above codebases,&n
                &mis ever expanding due to the efforts of Bluntmaster and Tek, the owners&n
                &mof &GThe Realms of Kuvia&m.  Along with his assistant coders, Slurk&n
                &mand Aenarion, they have created a world that can rival some of the&n
                &mlargest playerbased muds currently still in production today.&n

&BWe would also like to take this time to thank anyone who is not mentioned above that
has had some part in any of the above codebases enhancements or creations.&n
