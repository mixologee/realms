A Well-Kept Mountain Trail~
The narrow trail hugs the mountainside as it curves upwards. The constant roar
from the nearby volcano leaves the mountain in a state of upheaval, resulting in
numerous landslides. A massive stone wall has been constructed to the east,
protecting the trail from any falling rocks that may damage its surface. A few
cracks have appeared in the wall's surface, but overall it seems to be in good
repair.

A Well-Kept Mountain Trail~
Far above, the peak of this enormous volcano is hidden behind a shroud of mist
and smoke. Rockslides are a constant threat due to the volcanic action, but a
large retaining wall to the east protects the trail from any falling boulders or
debris. The path is wide and in good repair, save for a few ruts upon its
surface. The trail continues southwards as it climbs the mountainside.

A Well-Kept Mountain Trail~
A thick mist, pouring from a gaping hole in the retaining wall, shrouds the
path. A recent landslide must have proved too much for the wall. Most of the
debris has been cleared away from the path, and scaffolds have been erected
surrounding the hole. Repairs seem well under way, as evidenced by new blocks
of stone ready to be fitted. The trail continues north and south.

A Narrow Mountain Trail (I)~
The volcanic mountain thunders from above, seemingly ready to explode at any
moment. The ground shakes with power, and the rocks seem to loosen underfoot.
A thick mist cloaks the mountainside, making it impossible to see dangers that
may fall from above. The path is already badly damaged from the impact of
previous landslides. Boulders and and debris cover the trail, making it
difficult to cross. The parts of the trail that remain are riddled with gaps
that could send a person tumbling down the mountain. The little that remains of
the path heads to the north and south.

A Narrow Mountain Trail (I)~
The large mountain looming overhead produces a constant rumbling sound that
fills the air with its fury. Several large boulders have toppled accross the
trail, leaving it badly damaged. The thin trail hugs the mountain as it changes
direction. Previous landslides have cleared away all the vegetation that might
once have grown along the path, leaving it barren. A strange mist, cold and
unwelcoming, shrouds the mountainside. The path continues to the north and
east.

A Narrow Mountain Trail (I)~
The thin trail hugs the mountain as it changes direction. The mountain appears
to be a huge pile of black stones, many of which have toppled over the trail,
damaging it badly. The air thins at this high altitude, turning cold and moist.
The mountain walls seem to become more overbearing as the trail progresses. A
thick gray mist covers the mountainside like a veil. Small pebbles and rocks
slide down the side of the mountain as if anticipating an oncoming rockslide. 
The path continues to the south and west.

Two immense mountains meet here to form a pass. The trail is wide and sturdy.
The colossal mountains block the wind, making the area warm and secure. 
Shadows loom all around, as the tall mountain peaks block out the light. 
Despite the darkened skies, several small plants and shrubs line the trail. 
Large black birds can be seen flying in circles above, searching for prey and
squawking loudly at each other. The trail heads to the north and south.

Before a Giant Cave (I)~
The mountain range closes in to the south and west to create an alcove. The
stones in the mountainside are extremely smooth and glossy, a result that could
not have occurred naturally. To the east, a giant cave stands carved out of the
mountainside. The magnitude of the cave is awe-inspiring. The size of the cave
warrants taking a moment to pause and speculate about what creatures might live
within it. Thick tangles of vines and cobwebs hang over the mouth of the cave,
making it difficult to see farther inside.

A small path lies hidden by a magical spell cast long ago. The spell seems to
be fading in power, as the eastern wall fades in and out of existence. The
trail is clean and well-kept. Patches of green and yellow grass line the dirt
path. The sounds of a stream coursing down the mountainside can be heard in the
distance. The pathway continues to the west, and the entrance to a large cavern
can be seen to the east.

spring of crystal clear water feeds a creek running down the western side of the
hill. Colorful fish glide through the clear water with a grace that is
captivating. Tall green reeds sway along the edge of the spring. Blue-green
grass and blossoming wildflowers cover the remainder of the hillside. Several
large boulders encircling the pond provide an ideal resting spot. Despite its
serene appearances, the hillside has an ominous quality that is elusive to the
eye.

swiftly swimming downstream. Large green reeds flourish along the bank of the
creek. The water is shallow enough to walk through however, the wet stones look
slippery and could be hazardous if traversed too quickly. The stream is being
fed from the east and continues down towards the west.

luster is comparable to that of precious gems, and their beauty seems wasted
sitting on the bottom of a remote creek. Despite their radiance, the stones are
slippery and difficult to walk on. The water is deep and flows quickly in this
part of the creek. Further movement east or west of here warrants caution.

A large dam blocks the creek. A pool of water gently sits in front of the
obstruction, as it is unable to continue downstream. The dam was constructed by
piling twigs and logs on top of one another, with mud from the creek cementing
them together. Most likely used to protect a nest from predators, the structure
is obviously not manmade. Despite its sloppy appearance, the dam is
well-constructed and seems quite sturdy and impassable.

The dark stone walls of the immense cavern are jagged and harsh, its ceiling
lost in the shadows high above. The floor is an unforgiving collection of rocks
and pebbles that lie unevenly on the ground. Thick tangles of vines and cobwebs
hang over the mouth of the cave entrance. The vines block light from entering
the chamber, casting shadows everywhere. The darkness of the cave suits the
ambience. The cavern has a quality that is intangible, yet unmistakable: the
area exudes evil. The cave goes deeper to the east and exits to the west.

The cave is shrouded in darkness, as the only available light comes from the
entrance to the west. The cave is naturally enormous, but the dark walls, along
with extensive shadows, give the illusion that the cave is infinite in size and
depth. The size of the cavern causes each sound to be amplified, sending
booming echoes throughout. Strange, indistinguishable sounds come from
somewhere hidden in the shadows, but the darkness and echoes make it impossible
to trace them to an exact source. The cave continues to the east, while the
safety of the entrance is to the west. To the south, there is a small crevice
that is barely noticeable in the darkness.

The small oval cavern is dark and the air stale. Layers of spiderwebs and dust
encapsulate every corner and each stone. Along the western wall of the grotto
stands a old wooden ladder that is badly damaged and in dire need of repair. 
In addition to being warped and uneven, the ladder is missing several rungs, and
the safety of the device is questionable. The ladder appears to lead to another
cavern above. A giant cave is to the north.

white specks that seem to hover in the air to the north. Strange noises echo
loudly across the vast expanse of the cavern. In the center of the cave lies a
large skeleton. The beast is unrecognizable, but from the size of the bony
claws, long snout, and sharp teeth, it does not appear to be a beast that would
be preyed upon easily. A closer examination reveals that the cavern is littered
with old bones and skeletons. One thing is painfully clear: this would not be a
nice place to die.

upon layers of bones and skeletons. The skeletons are of all shapes and sizes,
ranging from small animals to giant beasts. In the center of the cavern sits a

The dark stone walls of the cave have been sanded down and smoothed into a
perfect, crescent-shaped cavern. The height of the cave is immense, standing at
least a hundred feet high and forty feet wide. Several torches adorn the walls,
shedding some light into the otherwise dark cavern. Several powerful-looking
glyphs have been drawn into the walls. They depict the use of fire and
omnipotent wizards to bring death to pitiful victims. The floor is soaked with
a large puddle of a viscous red liquid that could only be blood. No other signs
of battle are apparent. The area seems to close in to the north and open up to
the south.

door is ornately engraved with icons depicting power, prosperity, and faith. 
Several large torches line the walls, casting light into the eerie cavern. The
door appears to have withstood many an attack, as the iron has been marked with
numerous scratches, burns, and dents. The floor of the cavern is stained red
from all the blood that has been spilled here. Strangely, there do not appear
to be any mechanical devices attached to this enormous door to help open and
close it, only a small keyhole. The only other exit is a cavern to the south.

The Entrance to the Fire Giants' Keep (I)~
The keep has been constructed inside the actual mountainside. The construction
must have been a monumental undertaking, considering the size and breadth of the
keep. The entryway is massive, standing almost a hundred feet tall and fifty
feet wide. The black stone of the mountains must at one time have been smoothly
cut and polished. Now the stone walls are dusty and have lost their luster. 
Several candelabras line the walls, providing a generous amount of light to the
room. The floor lies in ruins, as the once-lavish carpets have been reduced to
threads, and the wooden planks beneath have been badly burned and warped. The
keep is unusually warm, and the air smells heavy with smoke. The hallway
continues to the north, while the doorway is to the south.

The Fire Giants' Keep (I)~
The once-majestic keep has seen better days. Tapestries hanging on the wall are
burnt and tattered. The magnificent carpets and flooring have become soiled and
shredded. Golden candelabras have turned green and are covered with layers of
ash and dust. The candelabras are empty, and if not for a strange glow
originating from down the hallway, there would be no light at all. It is
difficult to imagine how such a well-built and luxurious fortress could fall
into such ruin. Clearly it would take an immense power to overthrow such a
stronghold as this.

The Fire Giants' Keep (I)~
The great keep lies in ruin. The decor appears to have suffered from a horrible
fire, as the walls, floors, and all the luxurious ornamentation lie wasted. 
Silver and gray ashes cover the floor and gently float in the air. The steam
rising off the stone walls is indicative of the sweltering heat here. The
candelabras hanging on the walls are empty, and if not for a strange glow
emanating down the hallway, the room would be cast in darkness. Smaller
hallways branch off to the east and west, while the main passage through the
keep travels to the north and south.

A Guarded Hallway - West Wing (I)~
The hallway appears to be well-guarded. The area seems to have seen battle
already, as the walls are burnt and charred black. Several of the thick bricks
lining the walls are chipped and damaged from the combat. The hard stone floor
is stained with blood, and the entire area smells of decay. Strands of smoke
still hang in the air, leaving the hallway clouded by a thick haze. The only
light comes from small torches that have been fastened to the walls, but their
light is insufficient to overcome the blackness that fills the passageway.

A Guarded Hallway - West Wing (I)~
The hallway is well-guarded, and appears to have been the site of a number of
fierce battles. The thick bricks lining the corridor have been damaged and
badly burned. Bloodstains can be spotted along the floor, where victims were
slaughtered. Little remains of these victims, as their corpses were most likely
devoured by the vermin that can be seen scurrying about in the darkness. Smoke
still lingers in the air, floating eerily throughout the area. The torches
hanging on the walls seem to create more shadows than light. The hallway forks
to the north, south and west.

The massive passageway is lined with thick stone bricks that have been scorched
to a deep shade of black. Wisps of smoke linger throughout the hallway,
clouding the room in a thick haze. Torches are fastened to the walls, but they
burn dimly and are ineffective in lighting the corridor. Aside from the
torches, the passageway lacks any signs of civility or hospitality. The hallway
is not filled with decorative items or furniture, only by haunting shadows and
the dark creatures that seem to hide in them.

The dimly lit passageway appears to be well-guarded. The thick stone walls have
been charred from recent fire damage, leaving the corridor in a state of ill
repair. The battles have left the corridor barren, and no attempts have been
made to decorate the area or make it more hospitable. Shadows dance throughout
the large passageway as several small torches fastened to the wall attempt to
fight the darkness. Wisps of smoke linger in the air, further clouding the
room. Outlines of strange creatures can be seen shifting about in the
blackness, trying to remain hidden in the shadows. The hallway turns sharply,
heading west and south.

the corridor with its vile smell. Several torches have been fastened to the
walls to provide light, but are ineffective in penetrating the smoke and
darkness that shroud the area.

The large barracks has been converted into a debriefing room. Maps of battle
strategies are plastered onto the thick stone walls. A series of torches
encircle the room, each one casting a generous amount of light. The commanding
officer can address the soldiers from a podium near the northern wall. Several
war banners have been hung, depicting a coat of arms and the company's motto. 
The southern wall is marked with a tally accounting the number of enemies
slaughtered. The wall has countless markings, with each mark representing a
different victim. The only doorway leads out into the hall.

A Stone Hallway (I)~
The large hallway is lined with bricks that have been scorched and burned to a
deep charcoal black. The stone corridor is remarkably plain, with almost no
ornamentation or style. The passageway was clearly not designed to entertain
guests, but rather made for a more functional use. The torches lining the wall
provide a meager amount of light and leave the hallway cast in shadows. Vermin
can be seen scampering into the corners, trying to remain concealed, while the
shadows of larger creatures can be seen hidden in the darkness above. The
unattractive stone floor is covered with dust and rocks, but is relatively easy
to walk on.

Many of the bricks are discolored and appear scorched. Several torches are
fastened to the wall, but they cast only a faint amount of light. The flames
from the torches cast shadows throughout the room. Creatures appear to stir
from above, moving silently through the darkness, while small vermin scurry
about in the corners, trying to remain undetected. The hard stone floor is
covered with rocks and dust, but is still relatively easy to walk on.

covered in layers of dust and grime. Several filing cabinets sit in the corners
of the room, bursting with various documents. The only other piece of furniture
in the room is a large stone bench that sits along the southern wall. A few
small torches are fastened to the wall and cast a sparse amount of light
throughout the room. Stairs lead to an office above, and the hallway lies
through the eastern doorway.

An Administrative Office (I)~
The large office area is filled with stacks of parchments and documentation that
leave little room to move about. The gray stone walls are left bare and are
hardly visible behind the stacks of administrative work. Two stone chairs sit
in front of a sturdy iron desk. Both the desk and the chairs are covered in
parchments. All the papers are surrounded by a strange green aura, presumably
from a spell that protects them from local fire hazards. A large white sphere
hovers high in the air, providing ample light for the office. A stairwell
descends to the waiting room.

blackened by fire damage. The walls are riddled with cracks and fractures
received during the combat. Droplets of water trickle down from the stone roof,
mixing with the layers of ash and cinder on the ground and leaving the floor wet
and slippery. Several torches have been hung along the decrepit stone walls,
but they do little to brighten the gloomy corridor.

decayed. Water drips from the moist stone ceiling of the mountain in which the
hallway was built. The wet ground is freshly stained with blood and ashes. 
The passageway is dark, as the flickers of the torches are insufficient to
overcome the dreariness of the area. Shadows dance about the room in a dizzying
display, as if guided by a powerful force. The room appears to be a focal
point, as the hallway branches off in several directions.

Fire damage has reduced the well-constructed corridor to rubble. Smoke sifts
through the air, filling the hallway with its sharp odor. Stones and pieces of
brick from the damaged walls are strewn over the ground. The floor is covered
with bloodstains that appear to have been made recently. The blood has
attracted rodents, which can be spotted scurrying about the hallway in search of
food.

The area has suffered badly from recent warfare. The stone walls are badly
cracked, and there appears to be more brick on the ground than lining the walls.
Wisps of smoke still linger from the fire that has ravaged the area. The
hallway makes a sharp turn, extending to the south and east.

any furniture that was once here but the layer of ash lining the floor. The
ground is also littered with bricks and stone that have collapsed from the
damage. Torches have been hung along the walls, but the light is lost behind a
veil of smoke and shadows. The hallway heads to the west, while a large archway
leads into a private meeting room to the east.

attack strategies. Various reports detailing supplies and armaments are stacked

company motto is hung on the western wall. Several thick steel chairs are
placed strategically throughout the room, while a large stone bench can be found
against the southern wall. A large doorway to the east marks the entrance to

display. A metal trunk sits in the southeast corner to store the Captain's
personal belongings. The only other piece of furniture in the room is a large
iron table that has been kept clean, with the exception of a wine goblet and an
empty tray that haven't yet been removed. A set of stairs leads to a smaller
room above. The only other exit appears to be the anteroom to the west.

case has been constructed to hold various pieces of armor, weapons, and jewelry
that have been looted from noteworthy victims. The contents of the room are
clearly prized, as each item has been exquisitely cared for and positioned for
maximum effect. A large hearth and several candelabras provide a comfortable
amount of light to view the trophies without allowing them to be damaged. A
stairwell leads down into the Captain's office.

walls are well-cut and exquisitely crafted. The keep has seen better days, as
fire and battle seem to have destroyed most of the luxurious belongings and fine
decorative pieces. The battles could not have occurred too long ago, as the
stench of smoke and the heat of fires can be felt throughout the corridors. 
Despite the poor state of repairs, the keep has still maintained a sense of
grandeur throughout the massive ceilings and wide hallways.

This part of the hall is massive, standing almost a hundred feet tall and fifty

great fortress has been laid to waste by a force that must surely have been
among the most powerful in history. Silver and gray ashes cover what remains of
the floorboards, which are warped and burnt to cinders. Tapestries and other
ornate decorations have been reduced to dust. The hallway is uncomfortably
warm, and the air is thick with smoke and ash. Steam rising off the wall
indicates that whatever destroyed the fortress happened recently, as the
hallways have not yet had time to cool from the fires. A strange glow coming
from the north is the only source of light for the otherwise dark hallway.

covering the ground are all that remain of the lavish possessions that once

army could do such extensive damage to a fortress that was once deemed
impenetrable. The keep continues to the north and south.

splash against a small puddle that has collected on the ground. Thick black
smoke rises from the torches fastened to the wall. The light from the torches
reflects off the wet floor to create an eerie mix of light and shadows. The

As condensation collects on the walls, droplets of water splash against the
floor, producing an eerie echo throughout the area.

extensive damage to the keep. Several candelabras are mounted on the walls, but
they remain empty, leaving the room covered in darkness. Ashes and dust cover
the ground, remnants of what was once a rich and creative art collection. The
smoke lingers in the air, indicating that whatever destroyed this keep did so
recently. The thick smoke makes it impossible to see clearly, and one can only
hope there are no enemies hiding among the smoke and shadows.

deep shade of red, then fades to the black stone indigenous to the keep. A
magical cloud swirls high above in a beautiful display of light and color. The
floor is laid with intricately cut sandstone tiles that have a soft green glow
surrounding them. Flaming torches are ensconced along the walls to provide
light for the large cavern.

A Corridor Pulsating with Power (I)~
A magical cloud cloaks the roof of the cavern from vision. The cloud is
composed of a multitude of brilliant colors that swirl gracefully in the air. 
It simultaneously appears both beautiful and dangerous as bursts of energy fray
from the cloud like a colorful firecracker or a bolt of lighting. The cavern
walls pulsate, turning a deep shade of red and then fading into inky black
stone. Torches are ensconced along the walls to light the corridor. The
well-tiled floor is covered in sandstone that has been stained red.

A Corridor Pulsating with Power (I)~
The thick stone walls of the cavern pulsate with a magical energy. The glow of
the walls transforms from a deep shade of red to the blackness of night and then
back to the red again. The floor is covered in finely cut sandstone tiles that
form an intricate pattern on the ground. A faint green aura emanates from the
tiles. High above, a magical cloud dances through the air. The cloud is
composed of a collage of brilliant colors intertwining about to create a
wondrous vision. The light show is awe-inspiring as the magic cloud swirls
through the air with dizzying speed and splendor.

A Corridor Pulsating With Power (I)~
The walls of the cavern pulsate, emanating a deep red glow, which then turns to
darkness. The flames from the torches ensconced in the walls burn brightly in
contrast to the dark stone. The ground is covered in a patchwork of sandstone
tiles that form an intricate pattern along the floor. The tiles are surrounded
by a faint green glow that adds to the mystical ambience of the room. The most
spectacular sight is the giant magic cloud swirling high above. Bright colors
shimmer in an astounding display of light that looks both beautiful and deadly.
Colors burst forth from the cloud like lightning bolts, each one sending an
electric pulse through the air.

The Entrance to a Giant Laboratory (I)~
The massive entranceway stands over sixty feet high. Layers of shelves cover
every inch of the great walls. Rows upon rows of spell ingredients are all
well-labeled and sealed in glass jars. Thousands of books on arcane knowledge,
all immaculately kept, fill the shelves. Intricate designs that appear to be
magical in nature have been drawn on the floor. The entranceway is well-lit by
a glowing ball of light that hovers high above, casting a brilliant glow across
the threshold. The laboratory continues to the north, while a pulsating
corridor is to the south.

resting atop a small but hot flame. These jars glow brightly, giving off
mystical auras that appear powerful. The potions are of every color, and some
of them even appear to be changing color as they ferment. Large cupboards
lining the brick walls are filled with various powders, plant leaves and strange
items that look magical in nature. Other cupboards contain books listing
various ingredients and recipes for different spells.

The laboratory appears to be quite sophisticated, judging by the amount and
design of the equipment. Series of tubes connect a plethora of beakers and
vials together in a complex arrangement that spans the entire room. Magical
elixirs provide a psychedelic display sitting atop small flames, changing from
one brilliant color to the next as they are heated. As the potions boil, they
produce a sweet aroma that drifts through the air. A series of runes and
talismans have been hung on the wall and ceiling to help focus the powerful and
delicate magic.

tables are set up throughout the room, each one with a collection of experiments
on it. Glass beakers set on the tables glow brightly, filling the room with

The giant laboratory is an impressive sight. A complex web of tubing transports
and combines magical liquids that empty into large beakers. Dozens of such jars
and elixirs rest atop small flames produced from within a stone counter. As
they are heated, the potions change colors in a vivid display of light and
texture. The bubbling liquids produce an orange and yellow smoke that softly
wafts through the air. The powerful elixirs are surrounded by a bright aura
that somehow appears dangerous. Some of the potions seem to coagulate and move
as if the contents were alive.

dispersed around the room to help support the structure of the cave. The
pillars have been delicately carved and ornamented with golden leaves. Torches
have been fastened to the pillars in order to provide ample light for reading.
The corridor is lined with bookcases that tower overhead. The shelves are made
of thick oak, stained in a red finish that gives them an air of sophistication.
The bookcases are stocked, full of ancient volumes and scrolls about mystical
arts and incantations. The shelves and books are in pristine condition, despite
being very aged. It appears as if they are protected by a magical spell, as
each is surrounded by a faint green aura.

age, the books are in remarkable condition, as someone has gone to great lengths
to keep them preserved. The books are stored in custom-made shelves that have
been ornately decorated and carefully treated. The shelves are extremely
elegant and are designed to best display the treasured texts.

Most of the books seem quite ancient, dating back hundreds of years and
traversing many cultural barriers. Despite their antiquity the texts are all in
pristine condition. A large mahogany table sits in the center of the room to

The Fire Giants' Keep (I)~
Fire has ravaged the once-magnificent keep. The large stone walls are charred
and badly damaged. The floor is carpeted in ashes and soot where delicately
woven rugs once lay. Tapestries have been reduced to shreds, and the artwork to
dust. Smoke fills the hallway, making the air thick and heavy. The candelabras
hanging on the walls are empty, leaving the hallway shrouded in darkness. The
smoke and darkness cloud the hallway, making it difficult to spot any enemies
who may be lurking in the shadows. Through the dust and smoke, a mysterious
glow appears to the north. The keep also continues to the south.

floor vibrates from a powerful force below. The thick stone walls loom high
above, casting shadows everywhere. Several fires burn wildly about the area,
feeding off a source that is entirely unseen. Thick smoke fills the corridor,
making it difficult to breathe and even harder to see. The mysterious glow can
be seen coming from the north.

The Heart of the Keep (I)~
Located inside the very center of the mountain's core, the keep seems to exude a
mysterious power. The large stone walls of the keep stand tall and cast shadows
throughout the corridor. The ground seems to shake with fury and vengeance. 
Smoke and small fires burn off an unseen source, clouding the room and making it
difficult to see. The keep has been extensively damaged. The floorboards are
badly burned, and several have even fallen away, leaving a large gap in a
portion of the floor. A mysterious glow from the north appears to be getting
stronger, casting a strange blue-green light throughout the smoke-filled room.

coarse stone walls and the sloppy architecture suggest the passageway was not
built as part of the original layout of the keep. The dirt ground is littered
with debris from the keep above that has fallen through the damaged flooring. 
The passageway inclines sharply downward, leading farther below the rocky base
of the mountain. A sturdy iron ladder that has been secured to the wall leads
upwards, but its passage is impeded by thick wooden boards in the ceiling.

A Steep Subterranean Passage (I)~
A single torch is fastened to the coarse stone wall of the underground tunnel,
providing a meager amount of light. The tunnel's construction looks relatively
new, as iron scaffolding lines the walls for added support, and tools are
scattered about the ground. The passage looks to serve a practical function
apart from the main portion of the keep, as the design lacks any sort of
ornamentation or decorative style. The tunnel has been built on a steep incline
that makes it hard to stay balanced. Rocks and dust cover the hard ground,
making it even more difficult to gain a sure footing. The incline leads up
towards the heart of the keep or down below the rocky mountain base on which the
mighty fortress was built.

A Steep Subterranean Passage (I)~
The passage is deep below the ground's surface. The dark stone walls are jagged
and coarse. A solitary torch is fastened to the wall, but its flickering flame
is insufficient to lift the dreariness of the room. The stones and dirt that
compose the tunnel appear as if they could fall in and collapse at any moment.
The iron scaffolding that was designed to support the walls has fallen, making
the area susceptible to a cave-in. The passage has been built so sharply
inclined as to be almost perpendicular, making it difficult to maintain balance.
The passage appears to open up a bit further down, as a small yellow light can
be seen in the distance.

The structure of the room suggests a talented builder crafted it. The ceiling
is more than a hundred feet high, supported by a series of unobtrusive stone
pillars. Several candle holders hang from the walls and pillars, lighting the
room. The domed ceiling is painted with an exquisite depiction of the heavens
and the great gods looking down upon the world in judgement. An intricate mural
is painted across the upper portion of the walls, depicting the splendor of the
neighboring volcano. A series of stone tiles have been laid across the floor in
an elaborate design that appears significant in some way. A small podium sits
raised in the center of the room. A faint green aura surrounds the entire
chamber, and seems to have protected the room from the damage the rest of the
keep has suffered.

the oval room for guests to sit on. The walls are lined with red stone bricks
that have been expertly laid. Several shelves have been cut directly into the
walls of the antechamber. The shelves are stocked with glass containers that
are filled with various powders, plant leaves and potions. A bright yellow orb
hovers high above, shining ample light into the room. The chamber floor is
tiled with fine ivory marble. In the center of the floor, a large arcane symbol
has been crafted into the tiles and looks both lovely and dangerous. A faint
green aura surrounds the entire area. Two large archways frame the exits to the
north and south.

The domed ceiling of the inner chamber stands almost a hundred feet high, with
intricate designs carved into it. The stone walls are thick, but have been cut
so finely that they appear soft and subtle. The floor is tiled with the finest
ivory-colored marble in the world. A bright yellow orb hovers high above the
center of the room, radiating ample light throughout. The chamber was
constructed on so large a scale and with such grandeur that the current setup
appears meager and diminutive. The large chamber has been converted into a
rather modest-looking administrative office. A small metal desk rests in front
of the north wall of the room, with two iron chairs placed in front of it. The
only other furnishings are a series of cabinets that appear to be bursting at
the seams from the abundance of parchments and scrolls stuffed into them. A
large arched doorway to the south leads to the antechamber.

comfort in the way of light. The thick gray stones used to construct the walls
are strong and well-crafted. Thick iron scaffolding encircles the room, to
support what appears to be ongoing construction and expansion of the tunnels. 
The corridor is full of dust that makes the air heavy and difficult to breathe.
Scores of footprints are embedded into the hard dirt floor. The prints are
enormously large and gruesome, clearly made by predatory beasts. A chamber
appears to be to the west, while the dark passageway heads to the north and
east.

Large gray stones compose the thick walls of the passageway. The tunnel is only
partially built, and the corridor is surrounded with thick iron scaffolding to
offer additional support to the structure. Large bricks and other building
materials lie scattered about the ground, covered in a layer of dust. The
construction of the tunnel looks like a massive undertaking, due to the gigantic
size of the corridor and its underground location. The roof of the tunnel is
beyond vision, lost in the shadows high above. Several torches hang on the
wall, but the light they emit is quickly swallowed by the darkness. The tunnel
must hold deep importance to whoever ordered its construction, as the job
requires a painstaking amount of effort and a great deal of expense.

stone that are being excavated as part of the construction. Large iron
scaffolding is being erected to prevent the tunnel from collapsing. The job
looks like an enormous undertaking, especially since the only tools in sight
appear to be large pickaxes and stone hammers. The construction has left the
tunnel surrounded by dust and dirt that fill the air and make it difficult to
breathe. The ground is a patchwork of deep holes, as the tunnel is being
directed downward. Several torches have been fastened to the wall, but they
fail to break the darkness of the tunnel.

force. The hard dirt pathway is covered with giant footprints that have been

belong to ferocious creatures.

A Dark Passageway (I)~
The high ceiling is lost in the shadows, making it impossible to judge the
height of the passageway. The large stone walls lining the tunnel echo each
sound. The air is stale and filled with dust that seems to permeate the lungs.
The dirt floor is hard, with few pebbles and rocks to impede movement. Burned
into the dirt floor are footprints of giant beasts. The footprints look large
and gruesome, not the impressions of a friendly creature.

A Dark Passageway (I)~
Torches hang from brackets in the large stone walls. The dirt floor is tightly
packed and hardened into place. Several giant footprints appear to be burned
right into the ground. The footprints are as gruesome as they are large. 
Judging by the size, depth and distance of the prints, whatever made these
tracks must be a vicious predator. The prints indicate massive creatures with
sharp grasping claws, monsters that are both powerful and agile. To find one of
these creatures would be a harrowing experience, and the hallway is lined with
scores of these prints. The hallway could easily be mistaken for a road, as it
is large enough for convoys and wagons to pass through. Despite being
underground, the ceiling of this passageway is high above and lost in the
shadows.

A Dark Passageway (I)~
Torches hang from brackets in the stone walls. The large passageway seems to
devour the light, leaving shadows everywhere. The dirt floor is hard, as if it
has been baked in the hot sun for many years. Several large footprints have
been embedded into the hard dirt floor. Any creatures that could leave markings
that large warrant caution. The hallway is massive, causing the slightest sound
to send booming echoes throughout.

A Dark Passageway (I)~
Large stone walls line the passageway. The hallway is both wide and tall, and
could easily accommodate a small army marching through it. The dirt floor is
hard and smooth, with few pebbles and rocks to impede movement. The torches
fastened in brackets high up on the wall seem to cast more shadows than light.
Scores of giant footprints are embedded into the hard dirt floor. The
passageway travels to the east and to the west.

A Dark Passageway (I)~
Large stone walls, a solid dirt floor and a high ceiling make the border for the
passageway. The hallway is littered with scraps of metal and discarded tools.
In the center of the passage there is a large iron staircase leading downwards.
The ornate metal railing encircling the stairwell is in pristine condition and
looks to be newly renovated. The only other exit is west through the dark
passageway.

delicately carved into the metal steps. The hand railing is equally ornate. 
Intricate pictures of great battles and powerful wizards are carved from the
iron. The entire stairwell is surrounded by an eerie green aura.

An Intersection of Lava Tunnels (I)~
Several old lava tunnels meet to create a focal point for this massive cavern.
The lava has long since receded, but trace amounts of molten rock can still be
seen in an intricate lattice of cracks and crevices in the wall and ceiling. 
The glowing lava provides light and heat in the otherwise dank tunnels. A
staircase leading upwards stands in the center of the intersection. Lava
tunnels lead to the north, south and east.

The platform is surrounded by a blue aura and seems to offer protection from the
constant barrage of flames bursting up from the fiery river. The lava appears
to be the nesting ground for a powerful spell that brings forth the terrible
monsters residing here. Talismans and charms hang from the ceiling, depicting
the birth of various beasts from the molten river. Many cocoon-like balls rest
in the riverbed, and the creatures inside the transparent shell can be seen

Tools and various construction materials lie scattered on the floor, rusted and
ill-kept. There are torches fastened to the walls, but the light they cast is
engulfed immediately by shadows. The shadows linger in the air and surround the
area in darkness, as if they were guided by a magical force. The air is stale
and heavy. The passageway heads west.

ornately crafted. The keep is uncomfortably warm, and the area is clouded by
smoke and small fires that make it difficult to see. There is a door to the
north that is bordered by two large torches topped with brightly burning flames.
The door is covered with symbols that look ancient and powerful. A mystical
blue-green glow originates from behind the door, seeping out through the cracks
and filling the corridors with its eerie light. Doors to the north and south
lead off the main hallway.

Ancient artifacts hang along the walls in reverence to the great deities. 
Magnificent statues of the great sorcerers throughout history have been carved
and displayed throughout the room. The focal point of the room is a large,
gruesome-looking sacrificial stone. The sacrificial stone is lined with a satyr
skin blanket and ornamented with satyr horns. The stone table is stained red
from the numerous sacrifices performed on it. Candles surround the table in a
ceremonial fashion, with each flame blazing solemnly. A great altar is to the
north, while private chambers open to the east and west. The exit to the main
part of the keep is to the south.

one resting in a golden candlestick. A series of ceremonial robes are neatly
folded upon a shelf hanging from the western wall. A small table rests in the
corner, with a number of items used for personal grooming organized on it. A
large porcelain basin rests beside the table, filled with holy oil used to
purify offerings before they are sacrificed.

sorcerer Ifcarius that has been raised next to the altar. With its arm
outstretched, the statue holds a magnificent orb that shines an awesome
blue-green light that is almost blinding. The glow permeates the room in an
eerie mist, surrounding each item of the shrine with its power. The walls of
the shrine are adorned with sacred artifacts that seem to transcend themselves
as they shimmer in the strange light. Depictions of the mighty deities along
the walls appear to come to life with the magic of the orb.

Fire burns from the animal's nostrils, providing sufficient light for the large
hallway. The floor is composed of cobblestones interlaced in an intricate
pattern. Thick brown ivy has grown up from the cracks between the stones,
covering much of the walls and floors. To ward off predators, the blossoms on
the ivy spit out small flames that can be quite harmful. The hallway continues

wall are covered in thick brown ivy. The ivy has vibrant red blossoms that can
be very deadly, as they sporadically release small bursts of flames into the air
to ward off predators. The floor is a patchwork of cobblestones that are badly

covered with sharp thorns that drip a thick mucus that looks to be poisonous. 
Bright red blossoms spit out small flames at trespassers who might damage the
ivy's roots. Hidden behind the layers of ivy are intricate carvings of fierce
beasts. In one image, a wild boar snorts fire from its nostrils in a furious
expression of anger that lights the entire area.

eyes of the idols glow red and glimmer with an unworldly power. Thick brown
vines have grown atop the sculpture, entwining it in manner that looks both
violent and comfortable. The sharp thorns of the vines add to the fierce and
menacing appearance of the carvings.

attaching itself to the numerous carvings that have been etched into the granite
walls. The carvings have been expertly crafted and are in exquisite condition
despite the poor environment. Mythical creatures, fierce and deadly, stand in
judgement of all who pass through. The eyes of the idols burn with a mystical
fire that might inspire terror in the bravest soul.

Their fiery red eyes burn with indignation, while their stone faces are carved
with a look of pure contempt. Strings of brown ivy cling to the stone figures,
violently fastening themselves to each nook along the wall. The ivy's sharp
thorns provide a hint of the plant's deadly nature. Small bursts of fire shoot
out from the vine's blossoms to ward off predators. A worn-out path continues
to the north and south, while a sinister tunnel opens to the west.

rocky terrain, makes it difficult to travel at a quick pace. The tunnel is
composed of thick stone walls that echo each step. The warmth in the tunnel
causes droplets of condensation to form small puddles on the ground. Ominous
stalactites hang from the cavern overhead, their razor-sharp tips able to crush
a person in an instant should they fall. Several vultures can be seen hiding in
the shadows of the tunnel, awaiting their next feast.

using thick iron clamps to suspend the lifeless bodies. The victims were badly
tortured before they died, as the cadavers are all burned and covered with
scars. Many of the corpses are so badly mutilated and disfigured it is
difficult to tell which species they are. Maggots and lice crawl through the
open orifices, slowly eating away the skin and tissues. The hard floor is
stained red from the blood that has seeped into the stone, while piles of feces
rot in the hot tunnel.

The Walk of Pain (I)~
The darkened hallway smells of death and decay. A solitary torch flickers
against the darkness, casting shadows across the walk. The thick stone walls
bordering the walkway are stained red with the blood of those unlucky enough to
reside here. A small table can be seen in the corner, holding an array of tools
designed to inflict pain. Various types of restraints line the walls, many of
them still holding the remains of the unfortunate victims. Vermin crawl through
large cracks in the eastern wall, feasting unabashedly off the numerous corpses
left on display.

The Chamber of Death (I)~
The air reeks with the smell of decay. The dank room is infested with vermin
attracted to numerous piles of filth covering the ground. A fire pit fuming
with hot coals has been constructed in the center of the room. Giant chains
hang down from above the fireplace, with the charred remains of a corpse
fastened in them, suspended above the fire. A variety of large stakes and
knives have been mounted against the walls, clearly used as instruments of
torture. The stone walls have become stained red over the years from the blood
that has splattered against them.

The stone walls of the chamber seem to close in upon themselves. A large table
sits in the center of the room. A white sphere hovers over the table, casting a
blinding light around it. The table has several leather straps, used to
restrain the head, arms, legs and body, fastened to it. The straps look
well-used, as they are beginning to fray and are covered in blood. Surgical
instruments rest atop a smaller table off to the side. The instruments are
blunt and covered with rust and dried blood. Various swords, whips and prods
can be seen hanging on the walls, ready to be used.

A Worn-Down Path in the Giants' Keep (I)~
Likenesses of mythical creatures have been expertly carved into the stone walls
of the keep. The statues stand boldly, looking down in judgement at all who
pass through. A bright red glow emanates from the statues' eyes, which look as
if they could pierce the soul. Violent spurts of fire are spewed from the
mouths or nostrils of dragons, lizards and other such bestial carvings. Thick
vines of brown ivy infest the pathway, latching on and fighting for room in
which to grow. The ivy's colorful flowers discharge small bursts of flame into
the air to ward off predators.

Shadows fall across the darkened and decrepit path. The stone walls bordering
the pathway are made of thick black granite that looms from above. A series of
sculptures have been expertly carved into the wall, depicting a variety of
fierce and powerful creatures. The eyes of these creatures have an unworldly
red glow that might inspire terror in the fiercest soldier. The sculptures have
all been carved with contemptuous expressions designed to inspire fear and
humility. Flames spurt out of the creatures' mouths in a terrifying display
that lights the area.

blackness is only broken by bursts of flame created from the blossoms of the
fire ivy that has grown over the entire pathway. The explosion of ivy across
the area adds a wild ambience to the old pathway, which is composed of
broken-down cobblestones and thick granite walls. Mythical creatures carved
into the stone walls loom over the area, designed to humble all who pass.

A series of large red eyes looks down across the pathway in stern judgement. 
The eyes burn with an intensity that is not natural to this world. The faces
that the eyes belong to are equally frightful. Carved from the black stone
walls, each face is that of a fierce creature scowling down upon the world. 
Fire spews from the statues' mouths and nostrils with enough vigor to light the
entire area. The statues are in remarkably good condition, especially in
relation to the rest of the pathway. The cobblestones lining the path have worn
away and cracked. Vines of thick brown ivy have grown out from the ground and
overtaken most of the walls.

clothing border a thick iron door to the north. The statues are holding large
spears that have been crossed to form an arch over the doorway. Two torches
casting mystical blue flames high into the air border the entryway. The

well-crafted and appear to have a larger significance than the mere decorative
function. Several comfortable-looking chairs have been placed appropriately
across the room for waiting guests, and there is a small but elegant table at

Deep Within the Keep (I)~
Thick stone walls border the old cobblestone pathway. The likenesses of fire
gods have been carved into the stone of the walls. The statues' crooked mouths
and jagged lines make them look fierce and contemptuous. The ruby eyes glow
with a mystical energy, looking down upon the path in apparent judgement. 
Stalks of fire ivy have overwhelmed the room, adding to the wild and untamed
ambience. Bursts of flame shoot forth from the blossoms of the ivy to help ward
off trespassers. The flames do little to overcome the shadows haunting the
pathway.

Deep Within the Keep (I)~
The old cobblestone path is cracked and broken. Stalks of fire ivy have grown
between the cracks in the cobblestones and have flourished here. The vines grow
wildly across the room and up the wall. The ivy's bright red blossoms
periodically open their petals in order to spit out bursts of flame to keep
trespassers away from the roots. The ivy's flames provide little light for the
dark and smoky room. Through the darkness, a set of eyes stares out with a
penetrating glance. The eyes belong to a granite statue embedded into the stone
walls, a talisman to watch over the pathway.

Deep Within the Keep (I)~
The old cobblestones lining the ground have become cracked and worn away. 
Stalks of fire ivy have grown up from between the cracks to flourish here. 
Puffing sounds can be heard as the fire ivy's blossoms spit acidic flames into
the air to ward off predators. The smoke from the flames clouds the hallway,
making it difficult to see clearly. Sconces in the form of a dragon's head spew
mystical blue flames across the hallway that cast eerie shadows along the path.

Deep Within the Keep (I)~
The large stone walls of the keep tower beyond vision. Statues of powerful
deities have been carved into the granite walls. The statues' faces are carved
in an angry expression, their mouths twisted and contorted in rage. The eyes on
the carvings glow with a mystical fire that appears alive. Vines of fire ivy
grow along the walls, entwining themselves around the statues. The ivy produces
a brilliant red flower that spits out bursts of flame to protect itself against
predators. Sconces shaped in the form of a dragon's head spew forth a blue
flame that lights the hallway.

Deep Within the Keep (I)~
Large stone walls border an old cobblestone path worn away with age. Stalks of
fire ivy grow up from beneath the cobblestones and spread out across the ground
and up along the walls. The vines entwine themselves around exquisitely cut
statues that have been carved right into the stone walls. The statues are
carved in the image of the great fire gods looking down upon the path with a
stern expression. The most striking feature of the magnificent carvings are the
eyes, which seem to burn with an unworldly glow, as if they could come alive at
any moment.

Deep Within the Keep (I)~
A patchwork of cobblestone tiles lines the floor. The old stones have been worn
out with age, and many of them are cracked or eroded. Growing from between the
spaces of the cobblestones are thick stalks of fire ivy. The ivy produces a
brilliant red flower that releases bursts of flames into the air to keep
trespassers away from the roots. The smoke produced from the ivy's flames fills
the hallway in a hazy mist. Sconces carved in the shape of a dragon's head
release a mystical blue flame that casts an eerie light across the keep. A fire
hydra is here, its numerous heads locking in on your position.

Deep Within the Keep (I)~
The hallway is composed of smooth stone walls that are exquisitely cut and
ornately crafted. Carved into the walls are images of a great volcano about to
erupt. The effect of the picture is amplified by the smoke rising from the top
of the volcano, that fills the area with a cloud of mist that makes it difficult
to see. A mystical blue-green glow that fills the air seems to be originating
from somewhere to the west. The floor is a patchwork of old cobblestones that
have cracked and broken over the years. Stalks of fire ivy have grown from
beneath the stones to overtake much of the room, adding a wild ambience to the
area.
