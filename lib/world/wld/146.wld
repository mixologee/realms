On a Rocky Beach of Pearly Pink Sand~
The air is cool, the sun is warm, and the beach is bright with glistening pink
sand. The island appears to be the summit of a volcano that has gradually risen
above the waves, and is covered with thick green jungle. The air whispers with
the crashing of waves against the cliffs, and a peculiar thudding echoes across
the island. The cliff rises tall and sheer, impossible to climb, and the beach
stretches out into the distance, around the end of the visible island.

On a Rocky Beach of Pearly Pink Sand~
The air is cool, the sun is warm, and the beach is bright with glistening pink
sand. The island appears to be the summit of a volcano that has gradually risen
above the waves, and is covered with thick green jungle. The air whispers with
the crashing of waves against the cliffs, and a peculiar thudding echoes across
the island. The cliff rises tall and sheer, impossible to climb, and the beach
stretches out into the distance, around the end of the visible island.

An Outcropping of Black Rock~
Long ago this outcropping was formed when a lava flow was belched out of the
volcano and slid down to the sea, cooling rapidly as it met the water. Now it's
an absolutely wonderful place for a great evil to recline and lure her prey
from.

On a Beach of Pearly Pink Sand~
The sun is brightest on the beach, reflecting off the sand and the surf. The
air shimmers with heat, rising off of the sand, and the sound of gulls echoes
across the vastness. Bits of seaweed and driftwood form a ring of jetsam far up
the beach, and an occasional heavier object sits stuck in the soft sand, buried
by the tide. The passage of archons is marked by smooth trails in the sand.

The beach looks much smaller from here, and the ocean much broader, widening
until it disappears into the hazy horizon. The volcano looms far overhead,
occasionally letting out a small reminder of its dormancy. Birds cackle and caw
in the jungle, hidden by the thick tangle of vines and branches. The wind
whispers across the sand and through the trees, keeping you on your toes.

On a Cliff Carpeted with Tropical Plant Life~
The beach looks much smaller from here, and the ocean much broader, widening
until it disappears into the hazy horizon. The volcano looms far overhead,
occasionally letting out a small reminder of its dormancy. Birds cackle and caw
in the jungle, hidden by the thick tangle of vines and branches. The wind
whispers across the sand and through the trees, keeping you on your toes.

In a Dense Jungle~
The jungle is staggeringly dense, so thick that you can only wish for a machete.
As you push deeper, you have a hard time keeping track of where you are - the
sky is invisible, and the sound of the ocean comes from all directions. The
ground is completely covered in foliage, making it near impossible to identify
tracks. Fortunately, there's a big volcano to help you find your way - if you
can catch a glimpse of it.

In the Jungle on the Volcano~
The ground slopes downward from the increasingly visible crater above you, and
the jungle slowly thins. Here the foliage mostly consists of old trees and very
young shoots. The sky is overhead, unlike in the denser parts of the jungle,
and a warm wind blows down on you from time to time.

The Pirate Encampment~
A couple tents scatter the clearing, only one of the obvious signs of human
habitation here. A campfire smoulders on the ground, and the bare earth is
crisscrossed with tracks, barefoot and booted. A patch of plants here, a stray
lantern there - it all indicates a human presence. This could be a very good or
very bad thing.

In the Jungle on the Volcano~
The ground slopes downward from the increasingly visible crater above you, and
the jungle slowly thins. Here the foliage mostly consists of old trees and very
young shoots. The sky is overhead, unlike in the denser parts of the jungle,
and a warm wind blows down on you from time to time.

A Deep Alcove in the Rock~
The cavern is shallow, but deep enough to prevent rain from blowing in. Here,
the camp's more fragile and important items are stored, under close watch from
outside. It is dry and reasonably dark, a good place to hide from the creatures
that prowl the night.

On the Barren Lip of the Crater, Overlooking the Island~
The rocks of the crater are jagged and black from ancient explosions, and
encrusted with trusting lichen. The abyssal crater still throws off hot fumes
and ash from time to time, making it hazardous to stand here on the brink of
destruction - besides the obvious danger of falling. Nevertheless, there is a
breathtaking view of the island and blue-green ocean from here, one that most
people don't have the luxury of living long enough to enjoy.

The Mouth of a Cave, Weathered by Wind and Water~
Behind an almost solid wall of foliage and detritus lies the mouth of a seaside
cave, worn out of soft rock by constant action of wind and water over time. 
The air is moist and cool - at least in comparison to the jungle air - and
tastes of salt. The sounds of the world outside are muted, creating an eerie
silence only interrupted by dripping water.

Looking Down Into Darkness~
The cavern floor has fallen completely out from under you, and the water is at
its blackest. The surface ripples and bubbles as gases escape from the floor
far below you, bursting and sizzling as they reach the surface. You can't find
any hand or footholds to cling to - you have to go back or down.

The tunnel has been carved by foreign hands, and statues of crablike humanoids
have been erected along both sides of the passage, tilting at odd angles from
the shape of the cavern. Hot water and gas escape from the floor at more or
less regular intervals, hissing up around your legs as you pass through this
strange cavern.

In an Underwater Cavern~
The cavern is almost completely submerged, full of stagnant sea water. The
walls are encrusted with barnacles and slick with weeds, and the air is cold. 
The water is deep and dark, and the cavern floor drops out from under you from
time to time. It is impossible to resist the bad feeling about this cavern.

Looking Down Into Darkness~
The cavern floor has fallen completely out from under you, and the water is at
its blackest. The surface ripples and bubbles as gases escape from the floor
far below you, bursting and sizzling as they reach the surface. You can't find
any hand or footholds to cling to - you have to go back or down.

The Mouth of a Cave, Weathered by Wind and Water~
Behind an almost solid wall of foliage and detritus lies the mouth of a seaside
cave, worn out of soft rock by constant action of wind and water over time. 
The air is moist and cool - at least in comparison to the jungle air - and
tastes of salt. The sounds of the world outside are muted, creating an eerie
silence only interrupted by dripping water.

A Twisting Crag~
The volcanic rock here is twisted and cragged beyond belief. It is impossible
to see far in one direction before being blocked by a pillar or bulge in the
cavern wall. In the water, it is disorienting, making it difficult to find your
way.

In an Underwater Cavern~
The cavern is almost completely submerged, full of stagnant sea water. The
walls are encrusted with barnacles and slick with weeds, and the air is cold. 
The water is deep and dark, and the cavern floor drops out from under you from
time to time. It is impossible to resist the bad feeling about this cavern.

The Mouth of a Cave, Weathered by Wind and Water~
Behind an almost solid wall of foliage and detritus lies the mouth of a seaside
cave, worn out of soft rock by constant action of wind and water over time. 
The air is moist and cool - at least in comparison to the jungle air - and
tastes of salt. The sounds of the world outside are muted, creating an eerie
silence only interrupted by dripping water.

A Twisting Crag~
The volcanic rock here is twisted and cragged beyond belief. It is impossible
to see far in one direction before being blocked by a pillar or bulge in the
cavern wall. In the water, it is disorienting, making it difficult to find your
way.

Looking Down Into Darkness~
The cavern floor has fallen completely out from under you, and the water is at
its blackest. The surface ripples and bubbles as gases escape from the floor
far below you, bursting and sizzling as they reach the surface. You can't find
any hand or footholds to cling to - you have to go back or down.

Deep in an Underwater Cavern~
The water is completely black, except for what your light illuminates. The
walls are smooth and shiny, and the passage is oval in shape. Hot water and gas
occasionally rises from the narrow cracks in the floor, hissing up around your
legs.
